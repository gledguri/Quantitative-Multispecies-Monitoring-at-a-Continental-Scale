  abstract = {ABSTRACT: During the last three decades, aquaculture has been the fastest growing animal-food-producing sector in the world, accounting for half of the present seafood supply. However, there is a significant growth disparity among aquaculture-producing countries. The reasons why some countries have achieved remarkable growth in aquaculture while others have stagnated or even declined have not been determined. In this article, we investigate whether environmental regulations have an impact on aquaculture growth. Using a cross-country regression analysis, we show that stringent environmental regulations are negatively related to aquaculture growth, whereas GDP growth has a positive effect. Countries often face a difficult balancing act between growth and environmental considerations when devising regulations. Our empirical results suggest that stricter environmental regulations in developed countries have contributed to lower growth rates and that these countries are falling behind emerging and developing economies that have more lenient environmental regulations.},

  abstract = {The anthozoan sub-class Octocorallia, comprising approximately 3000 species of soft corals, gorgonians, and sea pens, remains one of the most poorly understood groups of the phylum Cnidaria. Efforts to classify the soft corals and gorgonians at the suprafamilial level have long thwarted taxonomists, and the subordinal groups in current use are widely recognized to represent grades of colony forms rather than clades. Molecular phylogenetic analyses of the sub-class do not support either the current morphologically based subordinal or familial-level taxonomy. To date, however, the resolution necessary to propose an alternative, phylogenetic classification of Octocorallia or to elucidate patterns of morphological evolution within the group is lacking. Attempts to understand boundaries between species and interspecific or intraspecific phylogenetic relationships have been hampered by the very slow rate of mitochondrial gene evolution in Octocorallia, and a consequent dearth of molecular markers with variation sufficient to distinguish species (or sometimes genera). A review of the available ITS2 sequence data for octocorals, however, reveals a yet-unexplored phylogenetic signal both at sequence and secondary-structure levels. In addition, incongruence between mitochondrial and nuclear gene trees suggests that hybrid speciation and reticulate evolution may be an important mechanism of diversification in some genera. Emerging next-generation genomic-sequencing technologies offer the best hope for a breakthrough in our understanding of phylogenetic relationships and of evolution of morphological traits in Octocorallia. Genome and transcriptome sequencing may provide enough characters to resolve relationships at the deepest levels of the octocoral tree, while simultaneously offering an efficient means to screen for new genetic markers variable enough to distinguish species and populations. © The Author 2010.

  abstract = {This report highlights the status of Norwegian coastal cod north of 62 ̊N including stock structure, monitoring, a rebuilding plan and potential management measures. The report contains limited information with respect to biology, ecosystems and coastal environmental factors. Northeast Arctic cod (NEAC) and Norwegian coastal cod (NCC), cannot be separated visually at the landing site. Thus, there is no way to manage quotas for the two stocks separately in real time. Only when the catch year is over, and all sampling is analyzed and quality assured, can the catch of coastal cod be calculated accurately. Genetic studies show a gradual change in the stock structure of coastal cod from north to south. This indicates that division into several management units can provide a basis for better protection of any "weaker components" throughout the distribution area. It must be noted, however, that such divisions will necessarily require increased scientific survey coverage and more intense fisheries sampling in order to provide data that would adequately represent any new management units. In general, based on the current stock situation, there seems to be a need for stricter measures south of 67 ̊N than north of this latitude. The Institute of Marine Research recommends that the following proposals should be considered for commercial fisheries: Reduced coastal fishing in the fall when there is less NEAC at the coast. Close areas / months where a lot of coastal cod is usually caught. Protect coastal cod spawning areas. Preserve a broad age and size composition. Consider revisions of fjord lines and more stringent fishery restrictions within fjord lines. Monitor and measure the effects of regulations. Further develop genetic methods and tools to operate on the "quayside", and hence quickly and efficiently capture dynamic changes in coastal cod catch. Promote "local-regional regulations" in areas where there is a very good knowledge base. The Institute of Marine Research also recommends special measures for the tourist- and recreational fishing.},

Yet, evaluating marine biodiversity along its dimensions is challenging and dependent on the power and accuracy of the available data collection methods. Here we combine three traditional survey methodologies (underwater visual census strip transects [UVCt], baited underwater videos [BUV] and small-scale fishery catches [SSFc]), and one novel molecular technique (environmental DNA metabarcoding [eDNA]—12S rRNA and cytochrome oxidase subunit 1 [COI]) to investigate their efficiency and complementarity in assessing fish diversity. We analysed 1,716 multimethod replicates at a basin scale to measure the taxonomic and functional diversity of Mediterranean fish assemblages. Taxonomic identities were investigated at species, genus and family levels. Functional identities were assessed using combinations of morphological, behavioural and trophic traits. We show that: (a) SSFc provided the higher taxonomic diversity estimates followed by eDNA, and then UVCt and BUV; (b) eDNA was the only method able to gather the whole spectrum of considered functional traits, showing the most functionally diversified and least redundant fish assemblages; and (c) the effectiveness of eDNA in describing functional structure reflected its lack of selectivity towards any considered functional trait. Our findings suggest that the reach of eDNA analysis stretches beyond taxon detection efficiency and provides new insights into the potential of metabarcoding in ecological studies.},

The use of blue water (i.e., surface and groundwater) in aquaculture also makes a significant contribution to global fish production. However, the blue revolution of aquaculture is associated with a wide range of environmental concerns, including habitat destruction, water pollution, eutrophication, biotic depletion, ecological effects, and disease outbreaks. In addition, blue carbon (i.e., carbon in coastal and marine ecosystems) emissions from mangrove deforestation due to shrimp cultivation are accumulating. To increase fish production for a growing global population, aquaculture must grow sustainably while at the same time its environmental impacts must reduce significantly. There is blue growth potential for increasing seafood production through the expansion of coastal and marine aquaculture, which is essential for sustainable development of the blue economy.},

The present study therefore sought to determine the concentration of some heavy metals in sediments and liver of Wild African Catfish (Clarias gariepinus) in Lake Kanyaboli, Kenya. Fish were collected with the aid of a gill net of mesh size 4” and 5” whereas bottom sediments were collected by ErkMan crab sampler. The concentrations of Cadmium, Chromium, Zinc, Copper, and Lead in lake sediment and in the liver of Clariasgariepinus were determined using Flame Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometry (FAAS). Mean differences were determined using ANOVA and separation of means with Tukey’s test. Correlation analysis was done to determine the relationship of heavy metal contamination in sediments and fish liver. Obtained results showed that mean metal concentration in sediments were Cd (0.49 ± 0.02 - 0.77 ± 0.02), Cr (4.26 ± 0.015 - 7.48 ± 0.042), Zn (79.61 ± 0.57 - 87.09 ± 1.01), Cu (14.03 ± 0.05 - 20.43 ± 0.55) and Pb (14.38 ± 0.96 - 155.56 ± 0.21). Metals concentrations were significantly (p {$<$} 0.05) higher in station 2 than at the other stations. The mean heavy metal concentrations in Clarias gariepinus liver were Cd (nd- 0.22 ± 0.01), Cr (0.37 ± 0.01 - 1.67 ± 0.03), Zn (7.12 ± 0.03 - 13.40 ± 0.32), Cu (2.12 ± 0.12 - 4.16 ± 0.12) and Pb (1.63 ± 0.33 - 14.40 ± 0.58). Zn exhibited a significant difference between the stations. Pearson’s correlation coefficient revealed positive correlation between heavy metals in sediments and fish liver except for Pb - Cd (r = -0.638; p = 0.849), Pb - Zn (r = - 0418; p = 0.689) and Pb - Cu (r = -0.461). The study concluded that Lake Kanyaboli contained elevated levels of heavy metals probably due to anthropogenic activities. Consequently, activities that cause the contamination should be discouraged by the suitable governmental agencies.},

Policy and legislation are likely to have an impact on the development of more sustainable aquaculture practices such as integrated multi-trophic aquaculture (IMTA). This study investigated the flexibility within the current governance frameworks across six European countries to allow for the adoption and management of IMTA. A snowball approach was used to identify relevant EU legislation, which was used as the basis by which to identify national/regional legislation which implemented EU requirements. This data was combined with a desk study to create a legislation overview for each of six countries, which was then subject to a Comparative Legal Analysis of the regulatory frameworks. Key findings were that inter alia: an existing policy focus on environmental sustainability and technological innovation may be an incentive for IMTA; and that the regulatory framework is complex and extensive and this may be a barrier to IMTA. Overall, this study found that national frameworks were generally amenable to experimental IMTA pilot schemes, but that for commercial expansion substantial regulatory reform would be required. Particularly, there may be a need for change to some aspects of legal regimes relating to the transfer of disease, fish health and food safety.},

  abstract = {Cumulative anthropogenic pressures have triggered a global decline in the health of marine ecosystems, and coral reefs, in particular, are in crisis. With climate and population-related pressures predicted to intensify in the coming decades, it is increasingly crucial to develop cost-effective and accurate monitoring tools to document changes to these important ecosystems. Environmental DNA (eDNA) coupled with metabarcoding is a powerful tool for surveying a wide variety of biota. Here, we develop a baseline eDNA toolkit targeting scleractinian corals and validate its performance in conjunction with data derived on traditional diver-based visual surveys at the Cocos (Keeling) Islands. Three assays targeting the ITS2 and 16S barcoding regions were designed, which broadly detected diversity within Scleractinia and Porifera. Our eDNA assays recovered 78 ITS2 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) from 25 scleractinian genera which is comparable to the level of diversity recorded on visual surveys (68 species from 26 genera). There were some notable differences in the species detected using eDNA versus visual records that may relate to either misidentifications, intragenic variation, differential assay performance or cryptic species. Our data demonstrate that a multi-assay eDNA analytical approach, applied on surface water collections, represents a powerful and complementary way to survey diversity that can also reveal fine scale spatial differentiation in community composition. With further refinement and improved reference databases, we envisage eDNA to become a powerful complement to visual surveys and to play a key role in monitoring the health and diversity of complex coral reefs ecosystems.},

In this study, we applied a steady‐state model, with four different formulations for vertical diffusivity, to northern anchovy (               Engraulis mordax               ) and Pacific sardine (               Sardinops sagax               ) eggs in the California Current region. Vertical mixing profiles, based on wind speed and hydrography, were combined with estimated terminal ascent velocities of the eggs based on measurements of egg buoyancy and size, to simulate the vertical profiles of the eggs. We evaluated model performance with two data sets: (1) vertically stratified tows for both species and (2) paired samples for sardine eggs from 3‐m depth and in vertically integrated tows. We used two criteria: whether the model predicted individual observed vertical profiles (1) as well as the observed mean and (2) better than the observed mean. Model predictions made with the formulation producing the most gradual profile of vertical diffusivity provided the best match to observations from both data sets and for both species. Addition of a random error term to the terminal ascent velocity further improved prediction for anchovy eggs, but not sardine. For the paired data, model prediction of integrated abundance from abundance at 3‐m depth had significantly lower mean square error than prediction based on a linear regression of 3{$\quad$}m on integrated abundance. Our results support the feasibility of using data from the Continuous Underway Fish Egg Sampler quantitatively as well as qualitatively in stock assessments.},

Faltering recruitment rates of Atlantic herring (               Clupea harengus               ) in the Norwegian Sea indicate a need to identify which mortality factors influence larval herring survival. Previous research suggests that increased predation pressure by Atlantic mackerel (               Scomber scombrus)               may contribute to the disconnect between spawning stock biomass and recruitment. To quantify the contribution of predation pressure by Atlantic mackerel to herring larval mortality, two research cruises were conducted within a probable “hot spot” (67–72° N) for intensified mackerel predation based on particle drift simulations. Mackerel stomach contents were analysed for herring larvae content using droplet digital polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR) with a quantitative molecular detection assay specific for herring. The ddPCR results demonstrate clear predation by mackerel on herring larvae and also suggest that the alternative use of visual examination may give misleading results. Our results show that mackerel should be considered a potentially important predator on herring larvae. The quantitative molecular assay presented here shows great promise as an efficient and specific tool to correctly identify and quantify predation pressure on early life-history stages of fishes.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Environmental laws around the world require some version of an environmental‐impact assessment surrounding construction projects and other discrete instances of human development. Information requirements for these assessments vary by jurisdiction, but nearly all require an analysis of the biological elements of ecosystems. Amplicon‐sequencing—also called metabarcoding—of environmental DNA (eDNA) has made it possible to sample and amplify the genetic material of many species present in those environments, providing a tractable, powerful, and increasingly common way of doing environmental‐impact analysis for development projects. Here, we analyze an 18‐month time series of water samples taken before, during, and after two culvert removals in a salmonid‐bearing freshwater stream. We also sampled multiple control streams to develop a robust background expectation against which to evaluate the impact of this discrete environmental intervention in the treatment stream. We generate calibrated, quantitative metabarcoding data from amplifying the 12s MiFish mtDNA locus and complementary species‐specific quantitative PCR data to yield multispecies estimates of absolute eDNA concentrations across time, creeks, and sampling stations. We then use a linear mixed effects model to reveal patterns of eDNA concentrations over time, and to estimate the effects of the culvert removal on salmonids in the treatment creek. We focus our analysis on four common salmonid species: cutthroat trout (               Oncorhynchus clarkii               ), coho salmon (               Oncorhynchus kisutch               ), rainbow trout (               Oncorhynchus mykiss               ), and sockeye salmon (               Oncorhynchus nerka               ). We find that one culvert in the treatment creek seemed to have no impact while the second culvert had a large impact on fish passage. The construction itself seemed to have only transient effects on salmonid species during the two construction events. In the context of billions of dollars of court‐mandated road culvert replacements taking place in Washington State, USA, our results suggest that culvert replacement can be conducted with only minimal impact of construction to key species of management concern. Furthermore, eDNA methods can be an effective and efficient approach for monitoring hundreds of culverts to prioritize culverts that are required to be replaced. More broadly, we demonstrate a rigorous, quantitative method for environmental‐impact reporting using eDNA that is widely applicable in environments worldwide.},

  abstract = {The impact of floating net cages culturing the seabass, Lates calcarifer, on planktonic processes and water chemistry in two heavily used mangrove estuaries in Malaysia was examined. Concentrations of dissolved inorganic and particulate nutrients were usually greater in cage vs. adjacent (≈100 m) non-cage waters, although most variability in water-column chemistry related to water depth and tides. There were few consistent differences in plankton abundance, production or respiration between cage and non-cage sites. Rates of primary production were low compared with rates of pelagic mineralization reflecting high suspended loads coupled with large inputs of organic matter from mangrove forests, fishing villages, fish cages, pig farms and other industries within the catchment. Our preliminary sampling did not reveal any large-scale eutrophication due to the cages. A crude estimate of the contribution of fish cage inputs to the estuaries shows that fish cages contribute only ≈2\% of C but greater percentages of N (32-36\%) and P (83-99\%) to these waters relative to phytoplankton and mangrove inputs. Isolating and detecting impacts of cage culture in such heavily used waterways - a situation typical of most mangrove estuaries in Southeast Asia - are constrained by a background of large, highly variable fluxes of organic material derived from extensive mangrove forests and other human activities. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Analysis of variance is particularly powerful for the analysis of univariate data. The traditional multivariate analogues, however, are too stringent in their assumptions for most ecological multivariate data sets. Non-parametric methods, based on permutation tests, are preferable. This paper describes a new non-parametric method for multivariate analysis of variance, after McArdle and Anderson (in press). It is given here, with several applications in ecology, to provide an alternative and perhaps more intuitive formulation for ANOVA (based on sums of squared distances) to complement the description pro- vided by McArdle and Anderson (in press) for the analysis of any linear model. It is an improvement on previous non-parametric methods because it allows a direct additive partitioning of variation for complex models. It does this while maintaining the flexibility and lack of formal assumptions of other non-parametric methods. The test- statistic is a multivariate analogue to Fisher’s F-ratio and is calculated directly from any symmetric distance or dissimilarity matrix. P-values are then obtained using permutations. Some examples of the method are given for tests involving several factors, including factorial and hierarchical (nested) designs and tests of interactions.},

We propose that it can be measured as the average dissimilarity from individual observation units to their group centroid in multivariate space, using an appropriate dissimilarity measure. Differences in beta diversity among different areas or groups of samples can be tested using this approach. The choice of transformation and dissimilarity measure has important consequences for interpreting results. For kelp holdfast assemblages from New Zealand, variation in species composition was greater in smaller holdfasts, while variation in relative abundances was greater in larger holdasts. Variation in community structure of Norwegian continental shelf macrobenthic fauna increased with increases in environmental heterogeneity, regardless of the measure used. We propose a new dissimilarity measure which allows the relative weight placed on changes in composition vs. abundance to be specified explicitly. © 2006 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/CNRS.},

Although most commonly used to determine species presence and measure biodiversity, eDNA approaches also hold great potential to obtain population-level genetic information from water samples. In this study, we sequenced a panel of multiallelic microsatellite markers from filtered water and fish tissue samples to uncover patterns of intraspecific diversity in the freshwater Round Goby (               Neogobius melanostomus               ) across their invaded range in the Laurentian Great Lakes region. Although we found that the concentration of nuclear eDNA is lower than mitochondrial eDNA, we nonetheless detected over two-thirds of all nuclear alleles identified from genotyped tissues in our eDNA samples, with the greatest recovery of common alleles in the population. Estimates of allele frequencies and genetic variability within and between populations were detected from eDNA in patterns that were consistent with individual tissue-based estimates of genetic diversity and differentiation. The strongest genetic differentiation in both eDNA and tissues exists in an isolation by distance pattern. Our study demonstrates the potential for eDNA-based approaches to characterize key population parameters required to effectively monitor, manage, or sustain aquatic species.},

Although most eDNA research is focused on leveraging genetic diversity to identify taxa, some recent studies have explored the potential for these approaches to detect within‐species genetic variation, allowing for population genetic assessments and abundance estimates from environmental samples. However, we currently lack a framework outlining the key considerations specific to generating, analysing and applying eDNA data for these two purposes. Here, we discuss how various genetic markers differ with regard to genetic information and detectability in environmental samples and how analysis of eDNA samples differs from common tissue‐based analyses. We then outline how it may be possible to obtain species absolute abundance estimates from eDNA by detecting intraspecific genetic variation in mixtures of DNA under multiple scenarios. We also identify the major causes contributing to allele detection and frequency errors in eDNA data, discuss their consequences for population‐level analyses and outline bioinformatic approaches to detect and remove erroneous sequences. This review summarizes the key advances required to harness the full potential of eDNA‐based intraspecific genetic variation to inform population‐level questions in ecology, evolutionary biology and conservation management.},

In this study, we collected three biological replicates of small volume water samples (1 L) at 2 depths at each of the 10 stations. We amplified fish mitochondrial DNA using a universal primer set. We obtained 5,644,299 high quality Illumina sequence reads from the environmental samples. The sequence reads were annotated to the lowest taxonomic assignment using a bioinformatics pipeline. The eDNA survey identified, to the lowest taxonomic rank, 7 families, 3 subfamilies, 10 genera, and 72 species of vertebrates at the study sites. These 92 distinct taxa come from 33 unique marine vertebrate families. We observed significantly different vertebrate community composition between sampling depths (0 m and 20/40 m deep) across all stations and significantly different communities at stations located on the continental shelf ({$<$}200 m bottom depth) versus in the deeper waters of the canyons of Monterey Bay ({$>$}200 m bottom depth).

  abstract = {Abstract                            Environmental DNA (eDNA) analysis from water samples is a promising new method to identify both targeted species and whole communities of aquatic organisms. However, the current literature regarding eDNA shedding rates primarily focuses on fish and most decay rate constants are reported for warm sunlit waters. Here, we conducted experiments to investigate how eDNA shedding differs between animal forms and how long eDNA can persist in waters of varying temperature and light conditions. We designed quantitative PCR assays for one fish (mummichog,               Fundulus heteroclitus               ), one crustacean (grass shrimp,               Palaemon               spp.), and two scyphomedusae (moon jelly,               Aurelia aurita               and nettle,               Chrysaora               spp.) to estimate eDNA shedding and decay rates. We found that shedding rates were highly variable for all organisms, but grass shrimp had the lowest shedding rate. We quantified eDNA decay rate constants at 6, 15, and 23°C and found that decay rate constants of mummichog and grass shrimp were larger at higher temperatures, while those of scyphomedusae did not show clear temperature dependence. We also found that higher‐order decay models with tails fit the data better than first‐order log‐linear models, suggesting temporal variability in eDNA decay rates. Results indicate that different animal forms shed different types of eDNA, impacting both shedding and decay rates. These findings fill critical knowledge gaps regarding variation in eDNA shedding and decay across animal forms under a range of realistic marine temperature conditions. These data will be useful for interpreting field studies that utilize eDNA to investigate ocean habitats that are otherwise difficult to access.},

  abstract = {Avoiding complementarity between primers when designing a PCR assay constitutes a central rule strongly anchored in the mind of the molecular scientist. 3'-complementarity will extend the primers during PCR elongation using one another as template, consequently disabling further possible involvement in traditional target amplification. However, a 5'-complementarity will leave the primers unchanged during PCR cycles, albeit sequestered to one another, therefore also suppressing target amplification. We show that 5'-complementarity between primers may be exploited in a new PCR method called COMplementary-Primer-Asymmetric (COMPAS)-PCR, using asymmetric primer concentrations to achieve target PCR amplification. Moreover, such a design may paradoxically reduce spurious nontarget amplification by actively sequestering the limiting primer. The general principles were demonstrated using 5S rDNA direct repeats as target sequences to design a speciesspecific assay for identifying Salmo salar and Salmo trutta using almost fully complementary primers overlapping the same target sequence. Specificity was enhanced by using 3'-penultimate point mutations and the assay was further developed to enable identification of S. salar x S. trutta hybrids by High Resolution Melt analysis in a 35 min one-tube assay. This small paradigm shift, using highly complementary primers for PCR, should help develop robust assays that previously would not be considered.},

However, its scaling properties are poorly understood. Here, we systematically assessed the spatial scaling of β-diversity using 12 empirical large-scale datasets including different taxonomic groups, by examining two conceptual types of β-diversity and explicitly considering the turnover and nestedness components. We found highly consistent patterns across datasets. Multiple-site β-diversity (i.e. variation across multiple sites) scaling curves were remarkably consistent, with β-diversity decreasing with sampled area according to a power law. For pairwise dissimilarities, the rates of increase of dissimilarity with geographic distance remained largely constant across scales, while grain size (or scale level) had a stronger effect on overall dissimilarity. In both analyses, turnover was the main contributor to β-diversity, following total β-diversity patterns closely, while the nestedness component was largely insensitive to scale changes. Our results highlight the importance of integrating both inter- and intraspecific aggregation patterns across spatial scales, which underpin substantial differences in community structure from local to regional scales.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Norway has complicated dynamics in the coastal ocean and in the fjords. In this area is also the largest salmon aquaculture industry in the world. The salmon industry is valuable for Norwegian economy worth more than 60 billion NOK. Thus, it is important to know the physical oceanography along the coast, even variability on short temporal and spatial scales (h/km), to be able to quantify environmental effects of the aquaculture industry. This is the motivation behind the implementation of a current model covering the whole coast of Norway with a relatively high spatial grid size of 800~m. The NorKyst800 is an implementation of the ROMS current model with an elaborated system of forcing and boundary conditions. This model has an important role for Norwegian authorities in various management purposes. We show that the NorKyst800 results are realistic and typically deviating at most by 1~°C and one unit in salinity from observations. The currents in the upper 10–20~m of the water column vary in a similar way as observed current and the agreement is good. The usefulness of a tool like the NorKyst800 is illustrated by an example of dispersion of salmon lice which is the biggest problem the salmon industry presently is facing. Detailed information, as can be provided by NorKyst800, is needed to fully understand and quantify environmental effects of the aquaculture industry. Similar modeling systems describing the planktonic salmon lice concentration operationally could be beneficial also in other salmon-producing countries like Scotland, Canada, or Chile. The major requirement will be access to updated number of fish and female lice per fish on a weekly time scale.},

The AZTI's Marine Biotic Index (AMBI), which consists on using macroinvertebrate diversity as indicator of ecosystem health, is used worldwide for this purpose. Yet, this index requires taxonomic assignment of specimens, which typically involves a time and resource consuming visual identification of each sample. DNA barcoding or metabarcoding are potential harmonized, faster and cheaper alternatives for species identification, although the suitability of these methods for easing the implementation of the AMBI is yet to be evaluated. Here, we analyze the requirements for the implementation of a genetics based AMBI (gAMBI), and show, using available sequence data, that information about presence/absence of the most frequently occurring species provides accurate AMBI values. Our results set the basics for the implementation of the gAMBI, which has direct implications for a faster and cheaper marine monitoring and health status assessment. © 2014 Aylagas et al.},

  abstract = {The use of genomic approaches to assist with biodiversity estimations is an alternative to traditional biomonitoring, which is very time-consuming and costly. In response to the high demand for quick community descriptions, DNA metabarcoding can simultaneously assign taxonomy to hundreds of samples rapidly and at low cost. However, the technique has not routinely been incorporated into biomonitoring network programs yet. Here, we applied DNA metabarcoding methodologies at stations within the monitoring network of the Basque Water Agency, the competent authority for the application of the European Water Framework Directive in this region. We characterized the benthic macroinvertebrate communities from 18 estuarine and coastal sediment samples using morphology and metabarcoding-based taxonomic identification and evaluated the performance of several versions of the AZTI's Marine Biotic Index (AMBI). Although metabarcoding detected 112 taxa against the 206 taxa identified through morphology, we showed that metabarcoding leads to similar biomonitoring conclusions compared with traditional techniques. Using the abundance and biomass of those taxa detected from morphological methodologies, we found a significant positive correlation with the number of reads obtained with metabarcoding approaches. The metabarcoding-based index derived from read counts, gAMBI, and the morphology-based index derived from individuals’ biomass, (B)AMBI, showed the best correlation and revealed excellent agreement at determining the ecological status of the stations analyzed. We calculated that, for the analysis of the 51 stations included in the Basque monitoring network, metabarcoding was 55\% less costly and 72\% less time consuming. The results of our study are relevant to policy makers and researchers in the field of ecological assessment and will contribute to the quick implementation of DNA metabarcoding to intensive monitoring programs.},

In marine environments, physical characteristics—such as tides and currents—can influence the distribution of eDNA. In this study, we make use of hatchery net pens containing {$>$}46\,million juvenile chum salmon (               Oncorhynchus keta               ) in nearshore Southeast Alaska to test for dispersion of eDNA and the effects of tide. Initially, we collected and filtered surface water every 80\,m along a 2\,km transect to test eDNA attenuation over surface distance during incoming and outgoing tides on a single day. The following year, we sampled at three depths (0\,m, 5\,m, and 10\,m) every 500\,m along the same transect as well as along a perpendicular transect, to understand dispersion by depth and in additional directions. Chum salmon eDNA was quantified using species‐specific qPCR. We found that surface samples showed a consistent signal of decreasing chum salmon eDNA across the 2\,km transect (               R               2               \,=\,0.665), with the majority of eDNA detections within 1.5\,km of the net pens. Tide had a significant effect, resulting in higher concentrations of chum DNA throughout the transect during incoming tide and a steeper decline in eDNA over distance during outgoing tide (               R               2               \,=\,0.759). Depth affected chum salmon DNA concentration, with the majority of eDNA at the surface and a decreasing amount of DNA with increasing depth. This study addresses one of the critical knowledge gaps in applying eDNA to marine fisheries management by providing empirical evidence of eDNA dispersion and demonstrating that most eDNA detections are likely from nearby individuals that are either currently or recently present. Yet even at close proximity, eDNA signal strength fluctuates and depends on the physical environmental variables during a given sampling event.},

Yet, the assessment and monitoring of the distribution and abundance of such mobile species in marine environments remain challenging, often invasive and resource-intensive. Here we pilot a novel, rapid and non-invasive environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding approach specifically targeted to infer shark presence, diversity and eDNA read abundance in tropical habitats. We identified at least 21 shark species, from both Caribbean and Pacific Coral Sea water samples, whose geographical patterns of diversity and read abundance coincide with geographical differences in levels of anthropogenic pressure and conservation effort. We demonstrate that eDNA metabarcoding can be effectively employed to study shark diversity. Further developments in this field have the potential to drastically enhance our ability to assess and monitor elusive oceanic predators, and lead to improved conservation strategies.},

Most eDNA metabarcoding studies have either focussed on the simultaneous identification of a few specific taxa/groups or have been limited in geographical scope. Here, we employed eDNA metabarcoding to compare beta diversity patterns of complex pelagic marine communities in tropical coastal shelf habitats spanning the whole Caribbean Sea. We screened 68 water samples using a universal eukaryotic COI barcode region and detected highly diverse communities, which varied significantly among locations, and proved good descriptors of habitat type and environmental conditions. Less than 15\% of eukaryotic taxa were assigned to metazoans, most DNA sequences belonged to a variety of planktonic “protists,” with over 50\% of taxa unassigned at the phylum level, suggesting that the sampled communities host an astonishing amount of micro-eukaryotic diversity yet undescribed or absent from COI reference databases. Although such a predominance of micro-eukaryotes severely reduces the efficiency of universal COI markers to investigate vertebrate and other metazoans from aqueous eDNA, the study contributes to the advancement of rapid biomonitoring methods and brings us closer to a full inventory of extant marine biodiversity.},

  abstract = {Coronavirus has claimed the lives of over half a million people world-wide and this death toll continues to rise rapidly each day. In the absence of a vaccine, non-clinical preventative measures have been implemented as the principal means of limiting deaths. However, these measures have caused unprecedented disruption to daily lives and economic activity. Given this developing crisis, the potential for a second wave of infections and the near certainty of future pandemics, lessons need to be rapidly gleaned from the available data. We address the challenges of cross-country comparisons by allowing for differences in reporting and variation in underlying socio-economic conditions between countries. Our analyses show that, to date, differences in policy interventions have out-weighed socio-economic variation in explaining the range of death rates observed in the data. Our epidemiological models show that across 8 countries a further week long delay in imposing lockdown would likely have cost more than half a million lives. Furthermore, those countries which acted more promptly saved substantially more lives than those that delayed. Linking decisions over the timing of lockdown and consequent deaths to economic data, we reveal the costs that national governments were implicitly prepared to pay to protect their citizens as reflected in the economic activity foregone to save lives. These ‘price of life’ estimates vary enormously between countries, ranging from as low as around \$100,000 (e.g. the UK, US and Italy) to in excess of \$1million (e.g. Denmark, Germany, New Zealand and Korea). The lowest estimates are further reduced once we correct for under-reporting of Covid-19 deaths.},

However, due to rapid-expansion of eDNA, confusion in terminology and collection/analytical pipelines can potentially jeopardize research progression, methodological standardization, and practitioner adoption in several ways. Present investigation reflects the developmental progress of eDNA (sensu stricto) including highlighting the successful case studies in conservation management. The eDNA technique is successfully relevant in several areas of conservation research (invasive/conserve species detection) with a high accuracy and authentication, which gradually upgrading modern conservation approaches. The eDNA technique related bioinformatics (e.g., taxon-specific-primers MiFish, MiBird, etc.), sample-dependent methodology, and advancement of sequencing technology (e.g., oxford-nanopore-sequencing) are helping in research progress. The investigation shows that the eDNA technique is applicable largely in (i) early detection of invasive species, (ii) species detection for conservation, (iii) community level biodiversity monitoring, (iv) ecosystem health monitoring, (v) study on trophic interactions, etc. Thus, the eDNA technique with a high accuracy and authentication can be applicable alone or coupled with traditional surveys in conservation biology. However, a comprehensive eDNA-based monitoring program (ecosystem modeling and function) is essential on a global scale for future management decisions.},

This will result in increased interactions with both local and regional environments, thus more knowledge is urgently needed to better risk-manage a rapid expansion. We investigated changes in the benthic sediment condition in association with an Atlantic salmon farm sited at a deep, well-flushed coastal site in western Norway. Benthic fluxes of O2, total carbon dioxide (TCO2) and NH4+ intensified over the production cycle, when farming activity and the sedimentation of carbon and nitrogen was at its maximum. During the sampling campaign, benthic fluxes of O2, TCO2 and NH4+ at the farming location were higher than those measured at a nearby reference location. Stimulation of benthic fluxes over the production cycle at the farming location were most likely driven by changes in benthic faunal community structure, abundance and biomass. High abundances of opportunistic species (i.e. Capitella capitata, Heteromastus filiformis, Paramphinome jeffreysii, Abra nitida and Thyasira sarsii) dominated the farming location, whilst the sediment biogeochemistry was stable throughout the study period at both locations. However, despite differences in benthic fluxes and fauna structure over the production cycle, the input of organic carbon and nitrogen did not exceed the mineralisation capacity of a deep, well-flushed, fish farming location. ©The authors 2014.},

De Queiroz (1998) introduced a distinction between two aspects of this problem: on the one hand, the definition proper, and on the other, the criteria allowing biologists to recognize species in practice. This distinction is a first step on the way toward a solution of the problem. In the present paper, we show that de Queiroz's distinction is made possible by the radical theoretical change introduced by Darwin. We emphasize that the species problem did not appear in the 20               th               century, but long before, and that Darwin addresses it indirectly in the               Origin of Species               . It might seem paradoxical to refer to Darwin's views about species, because they are usually considered as unclear. However, we propose that an analysis of these views in the context of Darwin's own theory of evolution might reveal how a definition of the concept of species is made possible by being anchored to the very theory of evolution. To this aim, we present a plausible reconstruction of Darwin's implicit conception of species and show how this conception fits with the debates on species that took place in the 18               th               and 19               th               centuries. We then turn to today's biology and show what changes Darwin's implicit conception of species has brought about relative to the species concept and species delimitation.},

However, few studies have investigated eDNA dynamics under natural conditions, and interpretations of eDNA surveillance results are clouded by uncertainties about eDNA degradation. We conducted a literature review to assess current understanding of eDNA degradation in aquatic systems and an experiment exploring how environmental conditions can influence eDNA degradation. Previous studies have reported macrobial eDNA persistence ranging from less than 1 day to over 2 weeks, with no attempts to quantify factors affecting degradation. Using a SYBR Green quantitative PCR assay to observe Common Carp ( Cyprinus carpio ) eDNA degradation in laboratory mesocosms, our rate of Common Carp eDNA detection decreased over time. Common Carp eDNA concentration followed a pattern of exponential decay, and observed decay rates exceeded previously published values for aquatic macrobial eDNA. Contrary to our expectations, eDNA degradation rate declined as biochemical oxygen demand, chlorophyll, and total eDNA (i.e., from any organism) concentration increased. Our results help explain the widely divergent, previously published estimates for eDNA degradation. Measurements of local environmental conditions, consideration of environmental influence on eDNA detection, and quantification of local eDNA degradation rates will help interpret future eDNA surveillance results.},

The rapidly expanding study of eDNA has generated unprecedented ability to detect species and conduct genetic analyses for conservation, management, and research, particularly in scenarios where collection of whole organisms is impractical or impossible. While the number of studies demonstrating successful eDNA detection has increased rapidly in recent years, less research has explored the “ecology” of eDNA—myriad interactions between extraorganismal genetic material and its environment—and its influence on eDNA detection, quantification, analysis, and application to conservation and research. Here, we outline a framework for understanding the ecology of eDNA, including the origin, state, transport, and fate of extraorganismal genetic material. Using this framework, we review and synthesize the findings of eDNA studies from diverse environments, taxa, and fields of study to highlight important concepts and knowledge gaps in eDNA study and application. Additionally, we identify frontiers of conservation-focused eDNA application where we see the most potential for growth, including the use of eDNA for estimating population size, population genetic and genomic analyses via eDNA, inclusion of other indicator biomolecules such as environmental RNA or proteins, automated sample collection and analysis, and consideration of an expanded array of creative environmental samples. We discuss how a more complete understanding of the ecology of eDNA is integral to advancing these frontiers and maximizing the potential of future eDNA applications in conservation and research.},

  abstract = {Aim: Beta diversity (variation of the species composition of assemblages) may reflect two different phenomena, spatial species turnover and nestedness of assemblages, which result from two antithetic processes, namely species replacement and species loss, respectively. The aim of this paper is to provide a unified framework for the assessment of beta diversity, disentangling the contribution of spatial turnover and nestedness to beta-diversity patterns. Innovation: I derive an additive partitioning of beta diversity that provides the two separate components of spatial turnover and nestedness underlying the total amount of beta diversity. I propose two families of measures of beta diversity for pairwise and multiple-site situations. Each family comprises one measure accounting for all aspects of beta diversity, which is additively decomposed into two measures accounting for the pure spatial turnover and nestedness components, respectively. Finally, I provide a case study using European longhorn beetles to exemplify the relevance of disentangling spatial turnover and nestedness patterns. Main conclusion: Assigning the different beta-diversity patterns to their respective biological phenomena is essential for analysing the causality of the processes underlying biodiversity. Thus, the differentiation of the spatial turnover and nestedness components of beta diversity is crucial for our understanding of central biogeographic, ecological and conservation issues. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

The main contribution made by research-vessel trawl survey data to the stock assessment process is to “tune” trends in the commercial data and provide estimates of incoming year-class strength. In this process much of the information contained with the survey data (e.g. spatial detail) is lost because the data are first aggregated into numbers-at-age indices for given areas. Another problem is that increasingly restrictive total allowable catches (TACs) imposed on the fishing industry have led to what is suspected to be widespread misreporting, i.e. the scientists do not know how many fish have been landed. This leads to negative biases in the catch data, low stock abundance estimates by scientists, even lower TACs, followed by even more misreporting. One potential way to escape this downward spiral is to explore scientific trawl survey data in more detail since trawl surveys are more straightforward to regulate. Traditionally, there has been resistance to this idea since, in comparison to commercial catch-at-age data, trawl survey data are very sparse in space and time. In this study, the potential for using trawl survey data independently in stock assessments is explored for the case of ICES Area VIa haddock, using two different tools. Findings suggest that it is possible to get qualitatively useful information from trawl survey data alone as well as quantitative, spatially resolved, estimates of fish abundance by making simple swept-area assumptions. In addition, interesting differences between survey and commercial data are highlighted by the study. The mean age of fish reported by the commercial fleet, for example, is higher than that reflected by the survey data, while fishing mortality estimates tend to be higher when estimated from survey data alone.},

  abstract = {Background: The heterogeneous nature of environmental DNA (eDNA) and its effects on species detection and community composition estimates has been highlighted in several studies in the past decades. Mostly in the context of spatial distribution over large areas, in fewer occasions looking at spatial distribution within a single body of water. Temporal variation of eDNA, similarly, has mostly been studied as seasonality, observing changes over large periods of time, and often only for small groups of organisms such as fish and amphibians. Methods: We analyzed and compared small-scale spatial and temporal variation by sampling eDNA from two small, isolated dune lakes for 20 consecutive weeks. Metabarcoding was performed on the samples using generic COI primers. Molecular operational taxonomic unit (MOTUs) were used to assess dissimilarities between spatial and temporal replicates. Results: Our results show large differences between samples taken within one lake at one point in time, but also expose the large differences between temporal replicates, even those taken only 1 week apart. Furthermore, between-site dissimilarities showed a linear correlation with time frame, indicating that between-site differences will be inflated when samples are taken over a period of time. We also assessed the effects of PCR replicates and processing strategies on general patterns of dissimilarity between samples. While more inclusive PCR replicate strategies lead to higher richness estimations, dissimilarity patterns between samples did not significantly change. Conclusions: We conclude that the dissimilarity of temporal replicates at a 1 week interval is comparable to that of spatial replicate samples. It increases, however, for larger time intervals, which suggests that population turnover effects can be stronger than community heterogeneity. Spatial replicates alone may not be enough for optimal recovery of taxonomic diversity, and cross-comparisons of different locations are susceptible to inflated dissimilarities when performed over larger time intervals. Many of the observed MOTUs could be classified as either phyto- or zooplankton, two groups that have gained traction in recent years as potential novel bio-indicator species. Our results, however, indicate that these groups might be susceptible to large community shifts in relatively short periods of time, highlighting the need to take temporal variations into consideration when assessing their usability as water quality indicators.}

In this review, we first examine the different possible effects of climate change that can operate at individual, population, species, community, ecosystem and biome scales, notably showing that species can respond to climate change challenges by shifting their climatic niche along three non‐exclusive axes: time (e.g. phenology), space (e.g. range) and self (e.g. physiology). Then, we present the principal specificities and caveats of the most common approaches used to estimate future biodiversity at global and sub‐continental scales and we synthesise their results. Finally, we highlight several challenges for future research both in theoretical and applied realms. Overall, our review shows that current estimates are very variable, depending on the method, taxonomic group, biodiversity loss metrics, spatial scales and time periods considered. Yet, the majority of models indicate alarming consequences for biodiversity, with the worst‐case scenarios leading to extinction rates that would qualify as the sixth mass extinction in the history of the earth.},

  abstract = {Background: Next generation sequencing (NGS) of amplified DNA is a powerful tool to describe genetic heterogeneity within cell populations that can both be used to investigate the clonal structure of cell populations and to perform genetic lineage tracing. For applications in which both abundant and rare sequences are biologically relevant, the relatively high error rate of NGS techniques complicates data analysis, as it is difficult to distinguish rare true sequences from spurious sequences that are generated by PCR or sequencing errors. This issue, for instance, applies to cellular barcoding strategies that aim to follow the amount and type of offspring of single cells, by supplying these with unique heritable DNA tags. Results: Here, we use genetic barcoding data from the Illumina HiSeq platform to show that straightforward read threshold-based filtering of data is typically insufficient to filter out spurious barcodes. Importantly, we demonstrate that specific sequencing errors occur at an approximately constant rate across different samples that are sequenced in parallel. We exploit this observation by developing a novel approach to filter out spurious sequences. Conclusions: Application of our new method demonstrates its value in the identification of true sequences amongst spurious sequences in biological data sets.},

  abstract = {Fish provides more than 4.5 billion people with at least 15 \% of their average per capita intake of animal protein. Fish’s unique nutritional properties make it also essential to the health of billions of consumers in both developed and developing countries. Fish is one of the most efficient converters of feed into high quality food and its carbon footprint is lower compared to other animal production systems. Through fish-related activities (fisheries and aquaculture but also processing and trading), fish contribute substantially to the income and therefore to the indirect food security of more than 10 \% of the world population, essentially in developing and emergent countries. Yet, limited attention has been given so far to fish as a key element in food security and nutrition strategies at national level and in wider development discussions and interventions. As a result, the tremendous potential for improving food security and nutrition embodied in the strengthening of the fishery and aquaculture sectors is missed. The purpose of this paper is to make a case for a closer integration of fish into the overall debate and future policy about food security and nutrition. For this, we review the evidence from the contemporary and emerging debates and controversies around fisheries and aquaculture and we discuss them in the light of the issues debated in the wider agriculture/farming literature. The overarching question that underlies this paper is: how and to what extent will fish be able to contribute to feeding 9 billion people in 2050 and beyond?},

Such environmental DNA (eDNA) methods offer an effective, noninvasive tool for species diversity measurement, although standardized protocols are not yet developed. We investigate how metrics of fish biodiversity revealed through eDNA analysis of water are influenced by sampling volume. Water samples were collected from the intertidal reef of Browse Island, a tropical, remote island in the Timor Sea. Aliquots from a single 20,700-ml sample and multiple 2,000-ml samples were filtered in various volumes (25–2,000~ml) across two membrane sizes (0.20 and 0.45~µm). A fish metabarcoding assay was used to characterize the fish diversity within aliquots. All samples, except one, yielded fish DNA sequences. Two hundred and nine operational taxonomic units (cf. species) representing 48 fish families were identified from the complete collection of DNA contained in all samples, comparable to the 200 fish species detected using conventional surveys at this location. Notable additions from eDNA methods were cryptic and nocturnal fish species. Nevertheless, large differences in taxonomic composition ({$<$}60\% species overlap) between aliquots of identical volumes demonstrate that eDNA in seawater is patchy and that estimates of biodiversity are strongly influenced by the volume of water filtered. We suggest that eDNA studies maximize water volumes as much as logistically possible if the aim is to detect the greatest number of taxa and that species accumulation curves be provided as an indication of sampling adequacy.},

The most common eDNA collection method in aquatic systems is actively filtering water through a membrane, which is time consuming and requires specialized equipment. Ecological studies investigating species abundance or distribution often require more samples than can be practically collected with current filtration methods. Here we demonstrate how eDNA can be passively collected in both tropical and temperate marine systems by directly submerging filter membranes (positively charged nylon and non-charged cellulose ester) in the water column. Using a universal fish metabarcoding assay, we show that passive eDNA collection can detect fish as effectively as active eDNA filtration methods in temperate systems and can also provide similar estimates of total fish biodiversity. Furthermore, passive eDNA collection enables greater levels of biological sampling, which increases the range of ecological questions that eDNA metabarcoding can address.},

The impacts of trawling on the physical, chemical and biological environment of the marine ecosystem and the diversity and quantity of by-catch and discards remain poorly documented for the tropical waters. In India, the by-catch landed at fishing harbours are utilized mainly for the production of manure and animal feed. Further, by-catch reduction devices have not been implemented in the field. This review article, besides analysing the impact of trawling, highlights the need for adopting policies and practices that reduce the level of by-catch, the need for ecosystem-based management to ensure longterm sustainability of oceanic resources, and the adoption of a precautionary approach with emphasis on reducing, and if possible avoiding discards.},

Here, we use metabarcoding of two markers of different lengths, derived from an annual time series of aqueous lake eDNA to examine temporal shifts in ecosystem biodiversity and in an ecologically important group of macroinvertebrates (Diptera: Chironomidae). The analyses allow different levels of detection and validation of taxon richness and community composition (β-diversity) through time, with shorter eDNA fragments dominating the eDNA community. Comparisons between eDNA, community DNA, taxonomy and UK species abundance data further show significant relationships between diversity estimates derived across the disparate methodologies.

  abstract = {Abstract             Molecular tools are an indispensable part of ecology and biodiversity sciences and implemented across all biomes. About a decade ago, the use and implementation of environmental DNA (eDNA) to detect biodiversity signals extracted from environmental samples opened new avenues of research. Initial eDNA research focused on understanding population dynamics of target species. Its scope thereafter broadened, uncovering previously unrecorded biodiversity via metabarcoding in both well‐studied and understudied ecosystems across all taxonomic groups. The application of eDNA rapidly became an established part of biodiversity research, and a research field by its own. Here, we revisit key expectations made in a land‐mark special issue on eDNA in Molecular Ecology in 2012 to frame the development in six key areas: (1) sample collection, (2) primer development, (3) biomonitoring, (4) quantification, (5) behaviour of DNA in the environment and (6) reference database development. We pinpoint the success of eDNA, yet also discuss shortfalls and expectations not met, highlighting areas of research priority and identify the unexpected developments. In parallel, our retrospective couples a screening of the peer‐reviewed literature with a survey of eDNA users including academics, end‐users and commercial providers, in which we address the priority areas to focus research efforts to advance the field of eDNA. With the rapid and ever‐increasing pace of new technical advances, the future of eDNA looks bright, yet successful applications and best practices must become more interdisciplinary to reach its full potential. Our retrospect gives the tools and expectations towards concretely moving the field forward.},

The starting point of each chapter is the ethnographic study of one particular place. However, the authors are also concerned with wider regional, national, and global forces which shape and influence the local economies and societies under review. Although most of the essays focus on the European coastline, the book is intended to have implications for other geographical areas. In most parts of the world, coastal settlements and contexts are changing rapidly and markedly. These contexts are routinely characterised by conflict between different interest groups contesting the ownership and control of the foreshore and its resources. One of the threads running through the volume is that coastal regions are often sites of fishing and related 'traditional' activities. The chapters discuss the relationships between traditional stakeholders, such as fishermen and local residents, and new stakeholders including new residents, second-home owners, tourists and tourism property developers, and fish farm managers as they vie for status, influence, and ultimately for space on the foreshore. The underlying preoccupation of the volume as a whole is the extent of penetration and transformation resulting from the onward march of capitalism and the market system in the coastal locations studied.},

New initiatives will be required to produce the necessary quantities of high quality protein. We explore a range of initiatives that will help to close this gap. We propose that three simultaneous changes will need to be made to meet future animal-derived protein demand. These are: shifting protein sources up the supply chain; use of plant-based substitutes or extenders for animal-derived protein foods; and use of novel sources for both animal and human nutrition. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            The increasing need to predict how climate change will impact wildlife species has exposed limitations in how well current approaches model important biological processes at scales at which those processes interact with climate. We used a comprehensive approach that combined recent advances in landscape and population modeling into dynamic‐landscape metapopulation models (               DLMP               s) to predict responses of two declining songbird species in the central hardwoods region of the United States to changes in forest conditions from climate change. We modeled wood thrush (               Hylocichla mustelina               ) and prairie warbler (               Setophaga discolor               ) population dynamics and distribution throughout the central hardwoods based on estimates of habitat and demographics derived from landscapes projected through 2100 under a current climate scenario and two future climate change scenarios. Climate change, natural forest succession, and forest management interacted to change forest structure and composition over time, variably affecting the distribution and amount of habitat of the two birds. The resulting changes in habitat and metapopulation processes produced contrasting predictions for future populations. Wood thrush, a forest generalist, showed little response to climate‐driven forest change but declined by {$>$}25\% due to reduced productivity associated with existing forest fragmentation across much of the region. Prairie warblers initially declined due to loss of habitat resulting from current land management; however, after 2050 cumulative effects of climate change on forest structure created enough habitat in source landscapes to restore population growth. These species‐specific responses were the result of interactions among climate, landscape, and population processes. We suggest relationships between climate change, succession, and land management are species specific and important determinants of future wildlife populations and that               DLMP               s are a comprehensive approach that can capture such processes to generate more realistic predictions of populations under climate change.},

This is derived from the proportions of individual abundance in five ecological groups, which are related to the degree of sensitivity/tolerance to an environmental stress gradient. The main difference with previously published indices is the use of a simple formula that produces a continuous Biotic Coefficient (BC) - which makes it more suitable for statistical analysis, in opposition with previous discreet biotic indices - not affected by subjectivity. Relationships between this coefficient and a complementary BI with several environmental variables are discussed. Finally, a validation of the proposed index is made with data from systems affected by recent human disturbances, showing that different anthropogenic changes in the environment can be detected through the use of this BI.

Climate change further exacerbates the cumulative effects of these activities and their associated pressures. Hence, effective management of these multiple activities is imperative to ensure the sustainable use of the ocean. In response to these challenges, we have developed a comprehensive conceptual framework model within an ecosystem-based approach. This framework encompasses a versatile toolbox designed to assess cumulative pressures effects and the environmental status under the European Marine Strategy Framework Directive, in compliance with the Birds and Habitats Directives requirements and the need to secure the maintenance of ecosystem services and provision of societal benefits. Although we use European examples in the current discussion, we consider that there are similar challenges in many seas worldwide and so the recommendations here are widely applicable. Our aim is to facilitate the validation, harmonization, and demonstration of this toolbox across European regional seas and several countries, at different scales, from local to regional, including overseas territories. This approach aims to foster comparability in environmental status assessments. We anticipate that the proposed methodologies will serve as a foundational benchmark against which progress can be assessed in line with expectations and policy requirements. Additionally, this work prepares the groundwork for the forthcoming evaluation of the suitability, robustness, and applicability of these solutions and tools, thereby assisting managers in achieving Good Environmental Status (GES), both in European and wider global contexts, to address challenges which are common worldwide.},

However, its utility for quantifying temporal changes in abundance, biomass, and diversity remains contentious. We investigated biotic and abiotic factors influencing temporal variation in eDNA concentration in large, 28,000\,L experimental mesocosms. Time series data demonstrated a positive relationship between the population abundance and biomass of the Cladoceran zooplankton species               Daphnia magna               and eDNA concentration, with a time lag of \textasciitilde 3.5\,days in 25°C conditions, and up to 28\,days in 15°C. Water temperature variations within mesocosms did not consistently influence eDNA quantity, although water temperature negatively predicted DNA concentration across mesocosms. Algal density negatively correlated with               D. magna               eDNA quantity across and within mesocosms. We demonstrate that eDNA signal detection can be used as a proxy for relative abundance and suggest that future investigation into the dynamics of eDNA shedding and degradation processes is warranted.},

Yet while there is an increasing diversity and volume of marine biodiversity data for training SDMs, little practical guidance is available on how to leverage distinct data types to build robust models. We explored the effect of different data types on the fit, performance and predictive ability of SDMs by comparing models trained with four data types for a heavily exploited pelagic fish, the blue shark (               Prionace glauca               ), in the Northwest Atlantic: two fishery dependent (conventional mark‐recapture tags, fisheries observer records) and two fishery independent (satellite‐linked electronic tags, pop‐up archival tags). We found that all four data types can result in robust models, but differences among spatial predictions highlighted the need to consider ecological realism in model selection and interpretation regardless of data type. Differences among models were primarily attributed to biases in how each data type, and the associated representation of absences, sampled the environment and summarized the resulting species distributions. Outputs from model ensembles and a model trained on all pooled data both proved effective for combining inferences across data types and provided more ecologically realistic predictions than individual models. Our results provide valuable guidance for practitioners developing SDMs. With increasing access to diverse data sources, future work should further develop truly integrative modeling approaches that can explicitly leverage the strengths of individual data types while statistically accounting for limitations, such as sampling biases.},

  abstract = {The number of species in an area is critical to the development of evolutionary and ecological theory from mass extinctions to island biogeography. Still, the factors influencing the accuracy of estimators of species richness are poorly understood. We explored these factors by simulating landscapes that varied in species richness, relative abundances, and the spatial distribution. We compared the extrapolations of nine nonparametric estimators and two species accumulation curves under three sampling intensities. Community evenness of species' abundances, sampling intensity, and the level of true species richness significantly influenced bias, precision, and accuracy of the estimations. Perhaps most surprisingly, the effects of gradient strength and spatial autocorrelation type were generally insignificant. The nonparametric estimators were substantially less biased and more precise than the species accumulation curves. Observed species richness was most biased. Community evenness, sampling intensity, and the level of true species richness influenced the performance of the nonparametric estimators indirectly via the fraction of all species found in a sample or "sample coverage." For each particular level of sample coverage, a single estimator was most accurate. Choice of estimator is confounded by a priori uncertainty about the sample coverage. Accordingly, researchers can extrapolate species richness by various estimators and base the estimator choice on the mean estimated sample coverage. Alternatively, the most reliable estimator with respect to community evenness can be chosen. These predictions from our simulations are confirmed in two field studies.},

  abstract = {The effects of waste from a salmon farm on the benthos of a fjordic sea loch on the western coast of Scotland have been studied. Within 3 m of the floating cages the sediment was highly reducing, and dissolved oxygen content of the water overlying the sediment ranged from 35 to 75\% saturation. At ≥ 15 m from the cages the sediment was oxygenated, and the dissolved oxygen content of the water overlying the sediment was 50-85\% saturation. Sedimentary redox potential and dissolved oxygen content of bottom water showed a seasonal variation. The benthic fauna showed marked changes in species number, species diversity, faunal abundance, and biomass in the region of the fish farm, with four zones of effect identified. Directly beneath, and up to the edge of the cages, there was an azoic zone. A highly enriched zone, dominated by Capitella capitata (Fabricius) and Scolelepis fuliginosa (Claparède), occurred from the edge of the cages out to as 8 m. A slightly enriched ″transitional ″ zone occurred at ≤ 25 m, and a "clean" zone at distances {$>$} 25 m. This study showed that salmon farming had similar effects on the benthos as other forms of organic enrichment, but the effects were limited to a small area in the immediate vicinity of the cages. © 1987.},

Prevailing patterns of light exposure do not optimally engage these actions for many individuals, but advances in our understanding of the underpinning mechanisms and emerging lighting technologies now present opportunities to adjust lighting to promote optimal physical and mental health and performance. A newly developed, international standard provides a SI-compliant way of quantifying the influence of light on the intrinsically photosensitive, melanopsin-expressing, retinal neurons that mediate these effects. The present report provides recommendations for lighting, based on an expert scientific consensus and expressed in an easily measured quantity (melanopic equivalent daylight illuminance (melaponic EDI)) defined within this standard. The recommendations are supported by detailed analysis of the sensitivity of human circadian, neuroendocrine, and alerting responses to ocular light and provide a straightforward framework to inform lighting design and practice.},

  abstract = {The impact of seismic surveys on the catchability of marine fish is a contentious issue, with some claims that seismic surveys may negatively affect catch rates. However little empirical evidence exists to quantify the impacts or identify the mechanisms of such impact. In this study, we used a 2-D seismic survey in the Gippsland Basin, Bass Strait, Australia in April 2015 as an opportunity to quantify fish behaviour (field-based) and commercial fisheries catch (desktop study) across the region before and after airgun operations. Three species found in abundance (gummy shark, swell shark, tiger flathead) were acoustically tagged and released within one of two acoustic arrays (experimental and control zone) and monitored before, during and after the seismic survey. In the field study, only 35\% of the gummy sharks and 30\% of the swell sharks were subsequently detected two days after release, suggesting movement outside the study area. Various tagged individuals returned sporadically over the monitoring period, including during the seismic survey operations. Behaviour consistent with a possible response to the seismic survey operations was observed for flathead which increased their swimming speed during the seismic survey period and changed their diel movement patterns after the survey. We also investigated the potential impacts of the seismic survey on catch rates using Commonwealth fisheries logbook data from Jan 2012–Oct 2015. Fifteen species and two gear types (Danish seine, gillnet) were modelled to examine differences in catch rates before and after the seismic survey. The catch rates in the six months following the seismic survey were significantly different than predicted in nine out of the 15 species examined, with six species (tiger flathead, goatfish, elephantfish, boarfish, broadnose shark and school shark) showing increases in catch following the seismic survey, and three species (gummy shark, red gurnard, and sawshark) showing reductions. With the exception of flathead movement, we found little evidence for consistent behavioural or catch rate changes induced by the seismic survey in the targeted species, although behavioural data were limited because many sharks left the acoustic receiver array prior to the commencement of the seismic survey.},

  abstract = {In recent years, environmental DNA analyses became increasingly integrated to detect and monitor the presence and abundance of rare organisms, especially in inaccessible aquatic habitats. Although it is generally proven that detection probabilities of eDNA surveys exceed those obtained via conventional techniques, these molecular approaches are, however, also subjected to detection limitations and levels of uncertainty. Besides improvements that can be made in terms of sampling design, volumes of filtered water, and the effective quantity of DNA that is finally analysed, the sensitivity of eDNA surveys is inherently determined by the number of target eDNA copies suspended in the water column. Here we show that multiplexing different primer/probe assays for the same species, but targeting amplicons situated at different loci, is a surprisingly overlooked aspect that can substantially contribute to reduce these limitations and increase the sensitivity of single-species detections. By empirically testing a large number of natural eDNA samples via ddPCR, we reveal that the use of multiple markers can significantly lower the LOD and LOQ of rare and elusive species, such as the invasive American bullfrog and the endangered European weather loach in a variety of different water bodies, such as ponds, lakes, streams, canals, etc. Especially at very low eDNA concentrations of both target species, our results showed that analysing mulitple loci significantly increased detection probabilities and lowered stochasticity effects, and thus ultimately reduces PCR costs when analysed in multiplex. The validation and use of more than one assay taregtting a single species, may further increase the confidence of positive detections. Finally, we illustrate that the implementation of internal positive controls (IPC's), is an absolute must for accurate validation of eDNA workflows and reliable interpretation of the generated data. IPC’s not only help to track down degraded and inhibited samples, to avoid false-negative detections, it also offers insights into extraction efficiency, indispensable for accurate quantification of population densities. Overall, our findings provide strong support that the multiplexing of multiple markers on different loci in combination with the use of internal positive controls ensures increased detection rates at very low eDNA concentrations and generates more robust and reliable data.},

In recent years, molecular survey methods detecting DNA released by target-species into their environment (eDNA) have been rapidly on the rise. Despite providing new, cost-effective tools for conservation, eDNA-based methods are prone to errors. Best field and laboratory practices can mitigate some, but the risks of errors cannot be eliminated and need to be accounted for. Here, we synthesize recent advances in data processing tools that increase the reliability of interpretations drawn from eDNA data. We review advances in occupancy models to consider spatial data-structures and simultaneously assess rates of false positive and negative results. Further, we introduce process-based models and the integration of metabarcoding data as complementing approaches to increase the reliability of target-species assessments. These tools will be most effective when capitalizing on multi-source data sets collating eDNA with classical survey and citizen-science approaches, paving the way for more robust decision-making processes in conservation planning.},

Most indicators of the state of biodiversity (covering species’ population trends, extinction risk, habitat extent and condition, and community composition) showed declines, with no significant recent reductions in rate, whereas indicators of pressures on biodiversity (including resource consumption, invasive alien species, nitrogen pollution, overexploitation, and climate change impacts) showed increases. Despite some local successes and increasing responses (including extent and biodiversity coverage of protected areas, sustainable forest management, policy responses to invasive alien species, and biodiversity-related aid), the rate of biodiversity loss does not appear to be slowing.},

With indirect survey methods, such as environmental DNA, such error can occur at two stages: sample collection and laboratory analysis. Here we analyse a large qPCR based eDNA data set using two occupancy models, one of which accounts for false positive error by Griffin et al. (J R Stat Soc Ser C Appl Stat 69: 377–392, 2020), and a second that assumes no false positive error by Stratton et al. (Methods Ecol Evol 11: 1113–1120, 2020). Additionally, we apply the Griffin et al. (2020) model to simulated data to determine optimal levels of replication at both sampling stages. The Stratton et al. (2020) model, which assumes no false positive results, consistently overestimated both overall and individual site occupancy compared to both the Griffin et al. (2020) model and to previous estimates of pond occupancy for the target species. The inclusion of replication at both stages of eDNA analysis (sample collection and in the laboratory) reduces both bias and credible interval width in estimates of both occupancy and detectability.

These activities traditionally focus on the measures of species diversity that include only information on the presence and abundance of species. Yet how diversity influences ecosystem function depends on the traits and niches filled by species.                                         2.               \enspace Biological diversity can be quantified in ways that account for functional and phenotypic differences. A number of such measures of functional diversity (FD) have been created, quantifying the distribution of traits in a community or the relative magnitude of species similarities and differences. We review FD measures and why they are intuitively useful for understanding ecological patterns and are important for management.                                         3.               \enspace In order for FD to be meaningful and worth measuring, it must be correlated with ecosystem function, and it should provide information above and beyond what species richness or diversity can explain. We review these two propositions, examining whether the strength of the correlation between FD and species richness varies across differing environmental gradients and whether FD offers greater explanatory power of ecosystem function than species richness.                                         4.               \enspace Previous research shows that the relationship between FD and richness is complex and context dependent. Different functional traits can show individual responses to different gradients, meaning that important changes in diversity can occur with minimal change in richness. Further, FD can explain variation in ecosystem function even when richness does not.                                         5.               \enspace{}               Synthesis and applications               . FD measures those aspects of diversity that potentially affect community assembly and function. Given this explanatory power, FD should be incorporated into conservation and restoration decision‐making, especially for those efforts attempting to reconstruct or preserve healthy, functioning ecosystems.},

  abstract = {Significance             For the fields of ecology, evolutionary biology, and conservation, abundance estimates of organisms are essential. Quantifying abundance, however, is difficult and time consuming. Using a data integration approach integrating expert-derived abundance estimates and global citizen science data, we estimate the global population of 9,700 bird species (∼92\% of all extant bird species). We conclude that there are many rare species, highlighting the need to continue to refine global population estimates for all taxa and the role that global citizen science data can play in this effort.           ,              Quantifying the abundance of species is essential to ecology, evolution, and conservation. The distribution of species abundances is fundamental to numerous longstanding questions in ecology, yet the empirical pattern at the global scale remains unresolved, with a few species’ abundance well known but most poorly characterized. In large part because of heterogeneous data, few methods exist that can scale up to all species across the globe. Here, we integrate data from a suite of well-studied species with a global dataset of bird occurrences throughout the world—for 9,700 species (∼92\% of all extant species)—and use missing data theory to estimate species-specific abundances with associated uncertainty. We find strong evidence that the distribution of species abundances is log left skewed: there are many rare species and comparatively few common species. By aggregating the species-level estimates, we find that there are ∼50 billion individual birds in the world at present. The global-scale abundance estimates that we provide will allow for a line of inquiry into the structure of abundance across biogeographic realms and feeding guilds as well as the consequences of life history (e.g., body size, range size) on population dynamics. Importantly, our method is repeatable and scalable: as data quantity and quality increase, our accuracy in tracking temporal changes in global biodiversity will increase. Moreover, we provide the methodological blueprint for quantifying species-specific abundance, along with uncertainty, for any organism in the world.},

Here, we have analyzed the fish eDNA contained in oceanic vertical profile samples (up to 2000 m depth) collected throughout the continental slope of the Bay of Biscay. We detected 52 different fish species, of which 25 were classified as deep-sea fish. We found an increase of deep-sea fish richness and abundance with depth, and that eDNA reflects day–night community patterns and species-specific vertical distributions that are consistent with the known diel migratory behavior of many mesopelagic fishes. These findings highlight the potential of eDNA to improve knowledge on the fish species inhabiting the dark ocean before this still pristine ecosystem is further exploited.},

The sampled water volume, a crucial aspect for efficient species detection, has been empirically variable (ranging from few centiliters to tens of liters). This results in a high variability of sampling effort across studies, making comparisons difficult and raising uncertainties about the completeness of eDNA inventories. Our aim was to determine the sampling effort (filtered water volume) needed to get optimal inventories of fish assemblages in species-rich tropical streams and rivers using eDNA. Ten DNA replicates were collected in six Guianese sites (3 streams and 3 rivers), resulting in sampling efforts ranging from 17 to 340 liters of water. We show that sampling 34 liters of water detected more than 64\% of the expected fish fauna and permitted to distinguish the fauna between sites and between ecosystem types (stream versus rivers). Above 68 liters, the number of detected species per site increased slightly, with a detection rate higher than 71\%. Increasing sampling effort up to 340 liters provided little additional information, testifying that filtering 34 to 68 liters is sufficient to inventory most of the fauna in highly diverse tropical aquatic ecosystems.},

  abstract = {The current biodiversity crisis calls for appropriate and timely methods to assess state and change of biodiversity. In this respect, environmental DNA (eDNA) is a highly promising tool, especially for aquatic ecosystems. While initial eDNA studies assessed biodiversity at a few sites, technology now allows analyses of samples from many points at a time. However, the selection of these sites has been mostly motivated on an ad-hoc basis, and it is unclear where to position sampling sites in a river network to most effectively sample biodiversity. To this end, hydrology-based models might offer a unique guidance on where to sample eDNA to reconstruct the spatial patterns of taxon density based on eDNA data collected across a watershed. Here, we performed computer simulations to identify best-practice criteria for the choice of positioning of eDNA sampling sites in river networks. To do so, we combined a hydrology-based eDNA transport model with a virtual river network reproducing the scaling features of real rivers. In particular, we conducted simulations investigating scenarios of different number and location of eDNA sampling sites in a riverine network, different spatial taxon distributions, and different eDNA measurement errors. We identified best practices for sampling site selection for taxa that have a scattered versus an even distribution across the network. We observed that, due to hydrological controls, non-uniform patterns of eDNA concentration arise even if the taxon distribution is uniform and decay is neglected. We also found that uncertainties in eDNA concentration estimates do not necessarily hamper model predictions. Knowledge of eDNA decay rates improves model predictions, highlighting the need for empirical estimates of these rates under relevant environmental conditions. Our simulations help define strategies for the design of eDNA sampling campaigns in river networks, and can guide the sampling effort of field ecologists and environmental authorities. \#\#\# Competing Interest Statement The authors have declared no competing interest.},

  abstract = {Environmental impacts of salmon cage aquaculture resulting from deposition of organic-rich particulate matter to the sea bottom have been thought to be a function of the local environmental conditions and management practices. However, testing of these suppositions have been limited by (1) widely varying monitoring methods employed, and (2) lack of data comparability resulting from the absence of standardized national monitoring schemes. In order to determine the sensitivity of different monitoring methods in detecting benthic environmental effects, a comparative analysis was undertaken of four methods commonly employed in Norway that vary in cost and expertise required: (1) visual diver surveys, (2) faunal analysis, (3) sediment chemistry, and (4) Sediment Profile Imagery (SPI). Results indicate that all methods agreed in the common "impact zone" under and immediately next to the cages. However, each of the methods differed in their sensitivity in detecting more subtle effects at greater distances from the cages. Data from 168 environmental survey samples located at various distances from working Norwegian salmon cage farms collected using similar methodology between 1996 and 1998 were analyzed to determine the relationship between environmental variables, management regimes, and levels of environmental impact. Total organic carbon (TOC) levels in sediments were significantly higher immediately adjacent to cages compared to reference sites, and approximately 32\% of the samples under the cages showed significant degradation. At intermediate distances (50-100 m), influences from fish farming are not clearly detected by TOC analysis. Further, while neither depth nor current speed alone are good predictors for environmental management, the results suggest recovery of sites by periodic abandonment (or fallowing) is one of the best management tools for sustainable salmon farming in cold-water environments. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

These changes occurred during a period of below-normal sea temperatures. We tested the effects of sea temperatures during maturation and mean size of mature fish on peak spawning times using regression analysis and found significant negative relationships for both independent variables. Results of a stepwise regression showed that fish length and sea temperature during maturation were equally important and together explained about 80\% of the spawning time variation. We suggest that maturation and migration are closely linked to seasonal warming and the zooplankton cycle. Given the high spawning mortality of capelin, it seems that this linkage favours maximum gonad production rather than adult survival. Knowledge of spring water temperatures would permit some prediction of capelin spawning time. However, the data series for mean length used in this analysis is not useful for predicting spawning time.},

The high‐throughput DNA sequencing of bulk samples offers many advantages over traditional morphological identification for describing community composition. Our objective was to evaluate the applicability of metabarcoding to identify species in taxonomically complex samples, evaluate biodiversity trends across broad geographical and temporal scales and facilitate cross‐study comparisons.                                         Location               Marine and freshwater ports along Canadian coastlines (Pacific, Arctic and Atlantic) and the Great Lakes.                                         Methods               We used metabarcoding of bulk zooplankton samples to identify species and profile biodiversity across habitats and seasons in busy commercial ports. A taxonomic assignment approach circumventing sequence clustering was implemented to provide increased resolution and accuracy compared to pre‐clustering.                                         Results               Taxonomic classification of over seven million sequences identified organisms spanning around 400 metazoan families and complements previous surveys based on morphological identification. Metabarcoding revealed over 30 orders that were previously not reported, while certain taxonomic groups were underrepresented because of depauperate reference databases. Despite the limitations of assigning metabarcoding data to the species level, zooplankton communities were distinct among coastlines and significantly divergent among marine, freshwater and estuarine habitats even at the family level. Furthermore, biodiversity varied substantially across two seasons reaching a beta diversity of 0.9 in a sub‐Arctic port exposed to high vessel traffic.                                         Main Conclusions               Metabarcoding offers a powerful and sensitive approach to conduct large‐scale biodiversity surveys and allows comparability across studies when rooted in taxonomy. We highlight ways of overcoming current limitations of metabarcoding for identifying species and assessing biodiversity, which has important implications for detecting organisms at low abundance such as endangered species and early invaders. Our study conveys pertinent and timely considerations for future large‐scale monitoring surveys in relationship to environmental change.},

At one site, the benthic community was subjected to bulk sedimentation and organic enrichment and reduced macrobenthic infaunal diversity and elevated levels of organic carbon were recorded close to the farm. In general, effects were restricted to a radius of 40 m around the farm. Conversely, at the second site, there were no observed effects of mussel biodeposits on the benthos and a diverse macrobenthic community persisted.

This method has improved detection rates over conventional survey methods and thus has demonstrated effectiveness for estimation of site occupancy and species distribution. The frontier of               eDNA               applications, however, is to infer species density. Building upon previous studies, we present and assess a modeling approach that aims at inferring animal density from               eDNA               . The modeling combines               eDNA               and animal count data from a subset of sites to estimate species density (and associated uncertainties) at other sites where only               eDNA               data are available. As a proof of concept, we first perform a cross‐validation study using experimental data on carp in mesocosms. In these data, fish densities are known without error, which allows us to test the performance of the method with known data. We then evaluate the model using field data from a study on a stream salamander species to assess the potential of this method to work in natural settings, where density can never be known with absolute certainty. Two alternative distributions (Normal and Negative Binomial) to model variability in               eDNA               concentration data are assessed. Assessment based on the proof of concept data (carp) revealed that the Negative Binomial model provided much more accurate estimates than the model based on a Normal distribution, likely because               eDNA               data tend to be overdispersed. Greater imprecision was found when we applied the method to the field data, but the Negative Binomial model still provided useful density estimates. We call for further model development in this direction, as well as further research targeted at sampling design optimization. It will be important to assess these approaches on a broad range of study systems.},

The field of eDNA is relatively new but growing rapidly, and it has the potential to disrupt current paradigms developed on the basis of existing measurement methods. After a general review of the field, we provide specific examples of the type of information that eDNA provides regarding the changing distribution of life in the sea over space (horizontally and vertically) and time. We conclude that eDNA analyses yield results that are similar to those obtained using traditional observation methods, are complementary to them, and because of the breadth of information provided, have the potential to improve conservation and management practices. Moreover, through technology development and standardization of methods, eDNA offers a means to scale biological observations globally to a level similar to those currently made for ocean physics and biogeochemistry. This scaling can ultimately result in a far better understanding of global marine biodiversity and contribute to better management and sustainable use of the world ocean. Improved information management systems that track methods and associated metadata, together with international coordination, will be needed to realize a global eDNA observation network.},

  abstract = {Mariculture activities including enclosure, raft and cage cultures employ a variety of plastic gear such as fishing nets, buoyant material and net cages. The plastic gear poses a potential source of microplastics to the coastal environment, but relevant data on the impacts of mariculture are still limited. To this end, a semi-enclosed narrow bay (i.e., Xiangshan Bay, China) with a long-term mariculture history was investigated to assess how mariculture activities affect microplastics in seawater and sediment. The results indicated that mariculture-derived microplastics accounted for approximately 55.7\% and 36.8\% of the microplastics in seawater and sediment, respectively. The average microplastic abundances of seawater and sediment were 8.9 ± 4.7 (mean ± SD, n = 18) items/m3 seawater and 1739 ± 2153 (n = 18) items/kg sediment, respectively. The types of mariculture-derived microplastics included polyethylene (PE) foam, PE nets, PE film, polypropylene (PP) rope, polystyrene (PS) foam and rubber. PE foam had the highest proportion (38.6\%) in the seawater samples. High usage rates and the porous structure of PE foam led to the high abundance. The average microplastic sizes of seawater and sediment are 1.54 ± 1.53 mm and 1.33 ± 1.69 mm, respectively. The spatial variations in the abundance and size of microplastics implied that the mariculture-derived microplastics in Xiangshan Bay were transported along the Bay to the open sea. The results of this study indicate that mariculture activity can be a significant source of microplastics. Further research is required to investigate how the high microplastic abundance in mariculture zone affects marine organisms, especially cultured seafood. Results of this work imply that the long-term intensive mariculture activities have caused a significant microplastic issue for Xiangshan Bay, China.},

Our projections show that climate change may lead to numerous local extinction in the sub-polar regions, the tropics and semi-enclosed seas. Simultaneously, species invasion is projected to be most intense in the Arctic and the Southern Ocean. Together, they result in dramatic species turnovers of over 60\% of the present biodiversity, implying ecological disturbances that potentially disrupt ecosystem services.

The speed and extent of warming in the Arctic and in regions of Antarctica (the Peninsula, at the present ) are greater than elsewhere. Changes impact several parameters, in particular the extent of sea ice; organisms, ecosystems and communities that became finely adapted to increasing cold in the course of millions of years are now becoming vulnerable, and biodiversity is threatened.

Diet composition from stomach contents, i. e. frequency of occurrence (FO) and Schoener's index (SI), and stable isotope signatures (δ 13C and δ 15N) in muscle of these sympatric gadoids were examined from two fjords in NE Greenland-Tyrolerfjord (TF, \textasciitilde 74 oN, sill present) and Dove Bugt (DB, \textasciitilde 76 oN, open). Twenty-three prey taxa and categories were identified and both gadoids ate mostly crustaceans. The SI values of 0.64-0.70 indicated possible resource competition, whereas FO differed significantly. A. glacialis fed mainly on the mysid Mysis oculata and other benthic-associated prey, whereas B. saida ate the copepod Metridia longa and other pelagic prey. Both diet and stable isotopes strongly suggest a spatial segregation in feeding habitat, with A. glacialis being associated with the benthic food web (mean δ 13C = -20.81‰, δ 15N = 14.92‰) and B. saida with the pelagic food web (mean δ 13C = -21.25‰, δ 15N = 13.64‰). The dietary differences and isotopic signals were highly significant in the secluded TF and less clear in the open DB, where prey and predators may be readily advected from adjacent areas with other trophic conditions. This is the first study on the trophic position of A. glacialis inferred from analyses of stable isotopes. The subtle interaction between the Arctic gadoids should be carefully monitored in the light of ocean warming and on-going invasions of boreal fishes into the Arctic seas. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.},

The use of 16S rRNA gene sequence data has revolutionized our understanding of the microbial world and led to a rapid increase in the number of descriptions of novel taxa, especially at the species level. It has allowed in many cases for the demarcation of taxa into distinct species, but its limitations in a number of groups have resulted in the continued use of DNA–DNA hybridization. As technology has improved, next-generation sequencing (NGS) has provided a rapid and cost-effective approach to obtaining whole-genome sequences of microbial strains. Although some 12{$\mkern1mu$}000 bacterial or archaeal genome sequences are available for comparison, only 1725 of these are of actual type strains, limiting the use of genomic data in comparative taxonomic studies when there are nearly 11{$\mkern1mu$}000 type strains.

However, biodiversity measurements often remain incomplete due to the limited efficiency of sampling methods. This is particularly true in freshwater tropical environments that host rich fish assemblages, for which assessments are uncertain and often rely on destructive methods. Developing an efficient and nondestructive method to assess biodiversity in tropical freshwaters is highly important. In this study, we tested the efficiency of environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding to assess the fish diversity of 39 Guianese sites. We compared the diversity and composition of assemblages obtained using traditional and metabarcoding methods. More than 7,000 individual fish belonging to 203 Guianese fish species were collected by traditional sampling methods, and \textasciitilde 17 million reads were produced by metabarcoding, among which \textasciitilde 8 million reads were assigned to 148 fish taxonomic units, including 132 fish species. The two methods detected a similar number of species at each site, but the species identities partially matched. The assemblage compositions from the different drainage basins were better discriminated using metabarcoding, revealing that while traditional methods provide a more complete but spatially limited inventory of fish assemblages, metabarcoding provides a more partial but spatially extensive inventory. eDNA metabarcoding can therefore be used for rapid and large-scale biodiversity assessments, while at a local scale, the two approaches are complementary and enable an understanding of realistic fish biodiversity.},

  abstract = {In the last few years, the study of environmental DNA (eDNA) has drawn attention for many reasons, including its advantages for monitoring and conservation purposes. So far, in aquatic environments, most of eDNA research has focused on the detection of single species using species-specific markers. Recently, species inventories based on the analysis of a single generalist marker targeting a larger taxonomic group (eDNA metabarcoding) have proven useful for bony fish and amphibian biodiversity surveys. This approach involves in situ filtering of large volumes of water followed by amplification and sequencing of a short discriminative fragment from the 12S rDNA mitochondrial gene. In this study, we went one step further by investigating the spatial representativeness (i.e. ecological reliability and signal variability in space) of eDNA metabarcoding for large-scale fish biodiversity assessment in a freshwater system including lentic and lotic environments. We tested the ability of this approach to characterize large-scale organization of fish communities along a longitudinal gradient, from a lake to the outflowing river. First, our results confirm that eDNA metabarcoding is more efficient than a single traditional sampling campaign to detect species presence, especially in rivers. Second, the species list obtained using this approach is comparable to the one obtained when cumulating all traditional sampling sessions since 1995 and 1988 for the lake and the river, respectively. In conclusion, eDNA metabarcoding gives a faithful description of local fish biodiversity in the study system, more specifically within a range of a few kilometers along the river in our study conditions, i.e. longer than a traditional fish sampling site.},

  abstract = {Abstract In the early 1980s, a strategy for graphical representation of multivariate (multi‐species) abundance data was introduced into marine ecology by, among others, Field, et al. (1982). A decade on, it is instructive to: (i) identify which elements of this often‐quoted strategy have proved most useful in practical assessment of community change resulting from pollution impact; and (ii) ask to what extent evolution of techniques in the intervening years has added self‐consistency and comprehensiveness to the approach. The pivotal concept has proved to be that of a biologically‐relevant definition of similarity of two samples, and its utilization mainly in simple rank form, for example ‘sample A is more similar to sample B than it is to sample C’. Statistical assumptions about the data are thus minimized and the resulting non‐parametric techniques will be of very general applicability. From such a starting point, a unified framework needs to encompass: (i) the display of community patterns through clustering and ordination of samples; (ii) identification of species principally responsible for determining sample groupings; (iii) statistical tests for differences in space and time (multivariate analogues of analysis of variance, based on rank similarities); and (iv) the linking of community differences to patterns in the physical and chemical environment (the latter also dictated by rank similarities between samples). Techniques are described that bring such a framework into place, and areas in which problems remain are identified. Accumulated practical experience with these methods is discussed, in particular applications to marine benthos, and it is concluded that they have much to offer practitioners of environmental impact studies on communities.

  abstract = {A comparison was made between catches from deepwater trawl and longline surveys (1993-2000) in the Northeast Atlantic. Longline catches were dominated by elasmobranchs, particularly squalid sharks and species numbers were low. Trawl catches had higher species numbers, with more teleosts, though elasmobranchs were still an important component. Species composition of the catch was depth dependent. Comparative trawl and longline surveys of the eastern and southern slopes of the Rockall Trough (west and north of Ireland) were used to examine size-selectivity. Trawls and longlines selected for significantly different size frequency distributions of Centroscymnus coelolepis and Deania calceus, though not for Centrophorus squamosus. These data highlight some important aspects of behavior of the species studying relation to fishing gears. Smaller C. coelolepis were selected by longlines than trawls, suggesting that smaller sharks were present at a considerable height above the seabed, out of reach of trawls, but attracted to baited hooks. In the case of D. calceus, larger females were selected by hooks, but were not present in trawl catches, possibly indicating their ability to escape towed gears. Trawl selectivity ogives were constructed for D. calceus and ogives for C. coelolepis and C. squamosus were simulated, using available data. Results suggest that longlines are not as selective for C. coelolepis as trawls. Selectivity ogives for D. calceus were similar in form, but longlines selected bigger individuals. Life history studies suggest that these species cannot sustain high fishing pressures. The implications of these results for the management of fisheries taking elasmobranchs are discussed.},

There are limited eDNA studies that evaluate vertebrate biodiversity in the marine environment or compare patterns of biodiversity with traditional methods. This study uses eDNA metabarcoding of the mitochondrial 12S rRNA genes present in seawater samples to characterize vertebrate biodiversity and distribution within National Marine Sanctuaries located in the California Current upwelling ecosystem. The epipelagic community in the study region has been monitored using traditional (mid-water trawl and marine mammal) survey methods since 1983. During 2016 and 2017, we concurrently sampled the epipelagic community using traditional survey methods and water for eDNA analysis to assess agreement among the methods. We collected replicate eDNA samples from 25 stations at depths of 10, 40, and 80 m, resulting in 131 small volume (1 L) environmental water samples to examine eDNA sequences. Across the eDNA and traditional survey methods, 80 taxa were identified. Taxa identified by eDNA partially overlapped with taxa through trawl and marine mammal surveys, but more taxa were identified by eDNA. Diversity and distribution patterns of marine vertebrates inferred from eDNA sequences reflected known spatial distribution patterns in species occurrence and community structure (e.g., cross-shelf and alongshore patterns). During both years, we identified fishery taxa Sebastes (rockfish), Merluccius (hake), Citharichthys (sanddab), and Engraulis (anchovy) across the majority of the stations using eDNA metabarcoding. The marine vertebrate assemblage identified by eDNA in 2016 was statistically different from the 2017 assemblage and more marine mammals were identified in 2017 than in 2016. Differences in assemblages identified by eDNA were coincident with different oceanographic conditions (e.g., upwelling and stratification). In 2016, weak upwelling and warmer than average conditions were measured, and vertebrate assemblages were not different among ecological regions [Point Reyes, Pescadero, and Monterey Bay]. While in 2017, average upwelling conditions returned, vertebrate assemblages differed at each region. This study illustrates that eDNA provides a new baseline for vertebrate assessments that can both augment traditional biomonitoring surveys and aid our understanding of changes in biodiversity.},

  abstract = {Phyto- and zooplankton in Arctic and sub-Arctic seas show very strong seasonal changes in diversity and biomass. Here we document the seasonal variability in the mesozooplankton community structure in a sub-Arctic fjord in Northern Norway based on monthly sampling between November 2018 and February 2020. We combined traditional morphological zooplankton identification with DNA metabarcoding of a 313 base pair fragment of the COI gene. This approach allowed us to provide the most detailed mesozooplankton species list known for this region across an entire year, including both holo- and meroplankton. The zooplankton community was dominated by small copepods throughout the sampling period both in terms of abundance and relative sequence counts. However, meroplankton was the most diverse group, especially within the phylum polychaeta. We identified four distinct periods based on the seasonal analysis of the zooplankton community composition. The pre-spring bloom period (February–March) was characterized by low abundance and biomass of zooplankton. The spring bloom (April) was characterized by the presence of Calanus young stages, cirripedia and krill eggs. The spring-summer period (May–August) was characterized by a succession of meroplankton and a relatively high abundance of copepods of the genus Calanus spp. Finally, the autumn-winter period (September–December) was characterized by a high copepod diversity and a peak in abundance of small copepods (e.g., Oithona similis, Acartia longiremis, Pseudocalanus acuspes, Pseudocalanus elongatus, Pseudocalanus moultoni, Pseudocalanus minutus). During this period, we also observed an influx of boreal warm-water species which were notably absent during the rest of the year. Both the traditional community analysis and metabarcoding were highly complementary and with a few exceptions showed similar trends in the seasonal changes of the zooplankton community structure.},

  abstract = {In this article, we use data on meat consumption, per capita income, and other socioeconomic variables for 150 countries to determine whether data support the hypothesis that per capita meat consumption follows a Kuznets-style inverted U-curve. In other words, as nations increase their real per capita incomes, while individuals at first consume more meat, ultimately, over time and with increased income, do they moderate their consumption? Our results signal that although there is evidence of a Kuznets relationship, the income at which our data suggests a deceleration of meat is large enough that for many countries this deceleration will not be reached in the foreseeable future. In a cross-section sample of low-income countries, we find no evidence of a Kuznets relationship. In a cross-section sample of high-income countries, we do find a potential Kuznets relationship and a deceleration of meat consumption at a per capita income of US\$49,848. In the full panel-data sample combining high- and low-income countries, including data on land area and urbanization, our results suggest an inflection point in meat consumption at an income of US\$36,375, still quite high for any realistic impact. Thus, our results highlight that effectively decelerating the global demand for meat may require aggressive and potentially controversial policy interventions, which, while leaving individuals with less choice, would address the otherwise devastating environmental impacts of increasing meat consumption. © 2013 Rivers Cole \& Mccoskey.},

Here, we quantify the breakdown of macrobial eDNA over a spatio-temporal axis of locally extreme conditions, varying from ocean-influenced offshore to urban-inshore, and between winter and summer. We report that eDNA degrades 1.6 times faster in the inshore environment than the offshore environment, but contrary to expectation we find no difference over season. Analysis of environmental covariables show a spatial gradient of salinity and a temporal gradient of pH, with salinity—or the biotic correlates thereof—most important. Based on our estimated inshore eDNA half-life and naturally occurring eDNA concentrations, we estimate that eDNA may be detected for around 48\,h, offering potential to collect ecological community data of high local fidelity. We conclude by placing these results in the context of previously published eDNA decay rates.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding is a reliable method to assess taxonomic diversity, but the incompleteness of genetic reference databases prevents the assignation of many sequences to a given species. Functional diversity (FD) is a key biodiversity facet to monitor, but it requires the identification of all species within communities to account for their trait values. So, the ability of eDNA‐based inventories to estimate the “true” level of FD is unknown. Here, using fish surveys in two representative temperate and tropical rivers, with a quasi‐exhaustive genetic and trait database, we measured the bias and variability of different FD indices when calculated with uncertainty in taxonomic assignment at the genus and family level. Our results show that when measuring FD indices with species randomly chosen within genera and families, the bias cannot exceed 30\% from real observed FD values. The variability is higher for species‐poorer communities and when those communities are composed of genera and families with high functional heterogeneity. Despite taxonomic uncertainty, our results demonstrate the potential of eDNA surveys to estimate reliable FD values.},

I take Johan Galtung's theory of violence as a point of departure, as a theory that is widely uncontested in peace studies. Galtung's articulation of direct, structural, and cultural violence offers a unified framework within which all violence can be seen. On the other hand, feminism can contribute to and enrich Galtung's theory of violence in four possible ways: 1. Galtung's theory needs to incorporate notions of gender as a social construct embodying relations of power. 2. Dichotomous, mutually exclusive categories that shape our understanding of the world are gendered and they are key to the production and reproduction of violence at all levels. 3. Gendered language defines the possibility and impossibility of pursuing different visions of the social world. Violence and peace can be constituted through language. 4. Violence produces and defines gender identities and, in turn, is produced and defined by them. These contributions have important implications for peace studies: only by taking gender seriously as a category of analysis, can prescriptions for a violence-free society be more than temporary solutions to deeply ingrained attitudes to accept violence as "natural."},

We suggest that scientific impediments to EBM are no longer significant to implement EBM operationally. Instead, we consider that approaching EBM within current policy cycle approaches would provide the necessary policymaking process step to operationalize EBM. In addition to enabling and facilitating collaboration, exchange, understanding as promoted by EBM, policymaking processes also require that policy is to be implemented through programs, measures, procedures and controls that have expected outcomes to "carry into effect" the policy objective. We are of the view that moving EBM from planning and objective setting to operational implementation is a management problem solving issues instead of a scientific one.},

  abstract = {Abstract             To reach the renewable energy targets set by the European Commission, a tenfold expansion of the installed offshore wind farms is needed. Since the construction of offshore wind farms may affect local soft‐sediment fauna, an efficient monitoring technique is needed to monitor the potential effects on the marine ecosystem. Here, we assess whether eDNA metabarcoding is a suitable alternative to monitor fish and epibenthos biodiversity in these difficult to access marine habitats. Water sampling and trawl surveys were conducted in parallel in 12 coastal and 18 offshore sites, the latter located inside and outside two offshore wind farms in the Belgian part of the North Sea. 12S eDNA metabarcoding retrieved 85.7\% of the fish species caught in the beam trawls, whereas the COI eDNA metabarcoding only identified 31.4\% of the epibenthic invertebrate species. Furthermore, the 12S marker resulted in an additional detection of 26 unique fish species, whereas the COI marker detected an additional 90 invertebrate species. Spatial patterns in alpha diversity recovered with eDNA metabarcoding were not significantly different from those observed with morphological determination. Significant differences were found in fish and invertebrate community structures between the coastal, transition and offshore zones as well as on the smaller wind farm scales, which agreed with the morphological beam trawl data. Indicator species found with morphological beam trawl monitoring for each of the three zones (coastal, transition, offshore) were also detected with 12S eDNA metabarcoding, and the latter method detected an additional 31 indicator species. Our findings show the need for adequate quality control of the obtained species lists and reveal that 12S eDNA metabarcoding analyses offers a useful survey tool for the monitoring of fish communities in offshore wind farms, but the used COI assay did not adequately capture the epibenthic communities as observed with beam trawl data.},

For each fishery, we estimate current biological status and forecast the impacts of contrasting management regimes on catch, profit, and biomass of fish in the sea. We estimate unique recovery targets and trajectories for each fishery, calculate the yearby- year effects of alternative recovery approaches, and model how alternative institutional reforms affect recovery outcomes. Current status is highly heterogeneous-the median fishery is in poor health (overfished,with further overfishing occurring), although 32\% of fisheries are in good biological, although not necessarily economic, condition. Our business-as-usual scenario projects further divergence and continued collapse for many of the world's fisheries. Applying sound management reforms to global fisheries in our dataset could generate annual increases exceeding 16 million metric tons (MMT) in catch, \$53 billion in profit, and 619 MMT in biomass relative to business as usual. We also find that, with appropriate reforms, recovery can happen quickly, with the median fishery taking under 10 y to reach recovery targets. Our results show that commonsense reforms to fishery management would dramatically improve overall fish abundance while increasing food security and profits.},

Although technological change and unequal consumption inextricably mingle with demographic impacts on the environment, the needs of all human beings—especially for food—imply that projected population growth will undermine protection of the natural world. Numerous solutions have been proposed to boost food production while protecting biodiversity, but alone these proposals are unlikely to staunch biodiversity loss. An important approach to sustaining biodiversity and human well-being is through actions that can slow and eventually reverse population growth: investing in universal access to reproductive health services and contraceptive technologies, advancing women’s education, and achieving gender equality.},

Although considerable progress has been made to translate EBFM from theory to practice, limited attention has been given to assessing the theoretical and practical linkages between EBFM and fisheries co-management. While EBFM and fisheries co-management are not new ideas, growing interest in both compels reflection on the interplay of these concepts, even though they have traditionally been viewed as disparate approaches. We report on the results of a literature review that explored the extent to which EBFM and fisheries co-management are linked. We describe the fundamental drivers, attributes, and desired outcomes commonly used to characterize these management concepts and quantify the degree of overlap in the literature. To illustrate how EBFM and co-management are integrated in practice, we present three examples. These examples highlight that these concepts exist on a continuum, with elements of co-management regularly appearing in conventional management regimes and elements of EBFM appearing in fisheries co-management initiatives.},

Applicability to detect and quantify fish allergen by droplet digital polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR) has been evaluated in this work. Genomic DNA of three fish species belonging to the most common fish families were analyzed. PCR primers were designed to amplify a 166 bp region of the 18S rRNA gene. Comparative studies were performed to establish the optimal primer and probe concentrations.~ Annealing temperature was determined by using thermal gradient. The results have shown good applicability of the optimized 18S rRNA gene-method to detect and quantify small amounts of the target in all samples analyzed. However, validation studies are needed in order to apply ddPCR technology for routine allergens analysis.},

Such changes are expected to disrupt productivity dynamics and alter marine food webs, with likely negative consequences for ecosystem services. It is, therefore, essential to devise and implement methods that can rapidly and inexpensively monitor changes in the marine food web structure. Unfortunately, conventional methods for surveying marine food webs are typically laborious, expensive and often destructive, resulting in only a small fraction of marine ecosystems being well studied, and an even smaller subset of them being studied through time. Here, we pilot a low-cost approach to reconstructing trophic networks of marine tropical, temperate and polar regions, using taxonomical inventories arising from published environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding studies, and building trophic links based on primary literature information. Although the trophic webs obtained are a simplified approximation of those constructed with traditional methods, they generate realistic networks that fit with expectations, and allow ecological inference over time scales and costs that are orders of magnitude smaller than that traditionally achieved. We show the potential of a new application of environmental DNA analysis that promises to offer a rapid and scalable approach to gather vital information on ecosystem structure, hence boosting marine monitoring at a time of increasingly rapid environmental changes.},

Wild catches being soon insufficient for responding to consumer demand, the cultivation of marine species appeared as a logical response to the need of seafood. Nevertheless, fish aquaculture also entails major impacts on wild populations from which genetic ones are now better known. The hybridization between domestic and native strains potentially have a genetic impact on recipient populations as long as 1) domestic populations are distinct from native wild ones (through domestication process, genetic improvement of captive stocks) and/or 2) the native wild populations are structured (metapopulation structure, local adaptation). Some of the flatfish species exhibit population differentiation and even local adaptation and the release of domestic genetically modified fishes (selected, transgenic) could threaten their survival in case of introgression. The impact of aquaculture on flatfishes is probably still low as land-based farms and low production levels guaranty low rates of escapes and therefore limited contacts between wild and farmed strains. However, flatfish aquaculture is regarded by experts as a rapidly growing domain that will greatly develop soon. In our opinion, this perspective, added to the quite good performances of farmed flatfishes when released into the wild, fully justifies a stronger interest from the scientific community to the conservation of their wild stocks. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

This can be achieved by developing and testing innovative and cost-effective monitoring systems, as well as indicators of environmental status. Here, we present several recently developed methodologies and technologies to improve marine biodiversity indicators and monitoring methods. The innovative tools are discussed concerning the technologies presently utilized as well as the advantages and disadvantages of their use in routine monitoring. In particular, the present analysis focuses on: (i) molecular approaches, including microarray, Real Time quantitative PCR (qPCR), and metagenetic (metabarcoding) tools; (ii) optical (remote) sensing and acoustic methods; and (iii) in situ monitoring instruments. We also discuss their applications in marine monitoring within the MSFD through the analysis of case studies in order to evaluate their potential utilization in future routine marine monitoring. We show that these recently-developed technologies can present clear advantages in accuracy, efficiency and cost.},

These tools promise to improve on traditional monitoring approaches by enhancing detection sensitivity, reducing analytical turnaround times and monitoring costs, and increasing specificity of target identifications.

Here, rather than explore technical aspects of method development, we examine impediments to effective translation of those methods into management contexts. In addition to surveying current use of DNA-based tools for aquatic invasive species monitoring, we explore potential sources of uncertainty associated with molecular technologies and possibilities for limiting that uncertainty and effectively communicating its implications for decision-making. We pay particular attention to the recent adoption of DNA-based methods for detection of invasive Asian carp species in the United States Great Lakes region, as this example illustrates many of the challenges associated with applying molecular tools to achieve desired management outcomes. Our goal is to provide a useful assessment of the obstacles associated with integrating DNA-based methods into aquatic invasive species management, and to offer recommendations for future efforts aimed at overcoming those obstacles. © 2011.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Aim               In coastal marine systems, biogenic reef‐building species have great importance for conservation as they provide habitat for a wide range of species, promoting biodiversity, ecosystem functioning and services. Biogenic reef persistence and recovery from perturbations depend on recolonization by new recruits. Characterizing larval dispersal among distant reefs is key to understanding how connectivity shapes metapopulation structure and determines network coherence; all of which are of critical importance for effective conservation.                                         Location               Northeast Atlantic coast and western English Channel, France.                                         Methods                                We used a biophysical transport model to simulate larval dispersal of the reef‐building polychaete                 Sabellaria alveolata                 . We combined dispersal modelling and network analysis into a framework aiming to identify key reef areas and critical dispersal pathways, whose presence in the network is vital to its overall coherence. We evaluated changes in dispersal pathways constrained by different connectivity thresholds, i.e., minimum dispersal rate for the presence of a connection. We tested scenarios of sequential loss of reefs: randomly, by habitat quality (a score for reef status and occupancy in an area) or by betweenness centrality metric (                 BC                 ; quantifying the proportion of shortest paths connecting all areas that are passing through any given area).                                                        Results                                We found that the network of                 S. alveolata                 reefs forms two main regional clusters, the Atlantic coast and the English Channel, which are connected only through weak sporadic dispersal events. Within each cluster, the network is characterized by relatively high connectivity among neighbouring areas with reefs, maintained even under higher connectivity thresholds. Simulating scenarios of sequential loss of reefs further identified high centrality reefs, those with highest                 BC                 values, key to network coherence.                                                        Main conclusions               Effective conservation of this important reef habitat requires a network of protected areas designed to sustain a combination of locally important source reefs, and those that act as stepping stones connecting distant reefs.},

This re-bordering is part of a broader punitive turn in the regulation of migration which has emerged, particularly in the European context, since the mid-1970s. On the one hand, non-western immigrants are targeted by prohibitionist immigration policies which in fact contribute to the reproduction of their status of illegality; on the other hand, the systematic use of incarceration (together with administrative detention and deportation) as the main strategy in the ongoing war against unauthorized immigration configures a dynamic of hyper-criminalization of immigrants, whose result is the intensification of their socioeconomic and political marginality across Europe. Following the materialist criminological approach known as political economy of punishment, this article suggests that these punitive strategies should be analyzed against the background of an increasingly flexible and de-regulated neoliberal economy: in this context, the hyper-criminalization of migrations contributes to the reproduction of a vulnerable labor force whose insecurity makes it suitable for the segmented labor markets of post-Fordist economies. © The Author(s), 2010.},

Typical 'solutions' proposed by politicians include increasing border controls or boosting African 'stay-at-home' development. However, such apocalyptic views are based on fundamentally flawed assumptions about the (limited) magnitude, historicity, nature and causes of this migration. Dominant discourses obscure the fact that African migration to Europe and Libya is fuelled by a structural demand for cheap migrant labour in informal sectors. This explains why restrictive immigration policies have invariably failed to stop migration and have had various perverse effects. African development is also unlikely to curb migration as it will enable and inspire more people to migrate. Despite lip service being paid to 'combating illegal migration' for political and diplomatic reasons, neither European nor African states have much genuine interest in stopping migration.},

As prices for most food commodities fall, fish prices are expected to rise, reflecting demand for fish that outpaces the ability of the world to supply it. The model shows that developing countries will consume and produce a much greater share of the world's fish in the future, and trade in fisheries commodities will also increase. The authors show the causes and implications of these and other changes, and argue for specific actions and policies that can improve outcomes for the poor and for the environment.},

  abstract = {The fisheries sector in the course of the last three decades have been transformed from a developed country to a developing country dominance. Aquaculture, the farming of waters, though a millennia old tradition during this period has become a significant contributor to food fish production, currently accounting for nearly 50 \% of global food fish consumption; in effect transforming our dependence from a hunted to a farmed supply as for all our staple food types. Aquaculture and indeed the fisheries sector as a whole is predominated in the developing countries, and accordingly the development strategies adopted by the sector are influenced by this. Aquaculture also being a newly emerged food production sector has being subjected to an increased level of public scrutiny, and one of the most contentious aspects has been its impacts on biodiversity. In this synthesis an attempt is made to assess the impacts of aquaculture on biodiversity. Instances of major impacts on biodiversity conservation arising from aquaculture, such as land use, effluent discharge, effects on wild populations, alien species among others are highlighted and critically examined. The influence of paradigm changes in development strategies and modern day market forces have begun to impact on aquaculture developments. Consequently, improvements in practices and adoption of more environmentally friendly approaches that have a decreasing negative influence on biodiversity conservation are highlighted. An attempt is also made to demonstrate direct and or indirect benefits of aquaculture, such as through being a substitute to meet human needs for food, particularly over-exploited and vulnerable fish stocks, and for other purposes (e. g. medicinal ingredients), on biodiversity conservation, often a neglected entity. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

  abstract = {The production of farmed salmonids in Chile reached 550 000 t in 2004. The industry is considered to be consolidated, but with potential for further expansion to the south into pristine coastal areas. The environmental impacts of the salmonid farming industry in Chile were reviewed in 1996, and evidence at that time did not suggest significant adverse effects. However, after almost ten years of sustained growth, current evidence indicates that significant loss of benthic biodiversity and localized changes in the physico-chemical properties of sediments have occurred in areas with salmonid farms. Furthermore, the presence of these farms significantly increases in pulses the density of dinoflagellates. Data suggest that escaped farmed fish may have an impact on native species, although their survival in the wild appears low. The abundance of omnivorous diving and carrion-feeding marine birds increased from twofold to fivefold in areas with salmon farms compared with control areas without them. It is urgent that an ecosystem approach be implemented to assess all impacts of salmonid farming on coastal ecosystems in southern Chile.},

  abstract = {The South China Sea (SCS) is an important part of the Indo-Pacific convergence zone, with high biodiversity and abundant marine resources. Traditional methods are primarily used to monitor biodiversity. However, a few studies have used environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding to research the assemblage structure of the SCS. This study used eDNA metabarcoding to survey the SCS assemblage and its relationship with environmental factors over a month-long time-series (August 30th to September 30th, 2020) of seawater samples from the central part of the SCS (9°-20°86' N, 113°-118°47' E). 32 stations were divided into six groups (A, B, C, D, E, F) according to longitude. We collected water samples, extracted eDNA, and amplified 18S rRNA gene V4 region (18S V4), 18S rRNA gene V9 region (18S V9), and 12S rRNA gene (12S). Krona diagrams were used to show species composition. We identified 192 phytoplankton, 104 invertebrate, and 61 fish species from 18S V4, 18S V9, and 12S, respectively. Generally, the three assemblage structures exhibited an increase in species diversity with increasing longitude. Group E had the highest fish diversity. Groups F and C had the highest phytoplankton and invertebrate diversity, respectively. Canonical correspondence analysis showed that four factors (chlorophyll a, depth, salinity, and temperature) were correlated with assemblage structure. Chlorophyll a was the main environmental factor that affected fish, phytoplankton, and invertebrate assemblage structures; salinity was strongly correlated with fish and invertebrate assemblage structures; temperature was a key factor that impacted fish and invertebrate assemblage structures; and depth was strongly correlated with invertebrate assemblage structure. Our results revealed that eDNA metabarcoding is a powerful tool for improving detection rate and using multiple markers is an effective approach for monitoring biodiversity. This study provided information that can be used to enhance biodiversity protection efforts in the SCS.},

  abstract = {Loss of biodiversity from lower to upper trophic levels reduces overall productivity and stability of coastal ecosystems in our oceans, but rarely are these changes documented across both time and space. The characterisation of environmental DNA (eDNA) from sediment and seawater using metabarcoding offers a powerful molecular lens to observe marine biota and provides a series of ‘snapshots’ across a broad spectrum of eukaryotic organisms. Using these next-generation tools and downstream analytical innovations including machine learning sequence assignment algorithms and co-occurrence network analyses, we examined how anthropogenic pressures may have impacted marine biodiversity on subtropical coral reefs in Okinawa, Japan. Based on 18 S ribosomal RNA, but not ITS2 sequence data due to inconsistent amplification for this marker, as well as proxies for anthropogenic disturbance, we show that eukaryotic richness at the family level significantly increases with medium and high levels of disturbance. This change in richness coincides with compositional changes, a decrease in connectedness among taxa, an increase in fragmentation of taxon co-occurrence networks, and a shift in indicator taxa. Taken together, these findings demonstrate the ability of eDNA to act as a barometer of disturbance and provide an exemplar of how biotic networks and coral reefs may be impacted by anthropogenic activities.}

Molecular approaches can identify diet items that are impossible to distinguish using more traditional visual‐based methods. Yet, our understanding of how different variables, such as predator species or prey ration size, influence molecular diet analysis is still incomplete. Here, we conducted a large feeding trial to assess the impact that ration size, predator species, and temperature had on digestion rates estimated with visual identification, qPCR, and metabarcoding. Our trial was conducted by feeding two rations of Chinook salmon (               Oncorhynchus tshawytscha               ) to two piscivorous fish species (largemouth bass [               Micropterus salmoides               ] and channel catfish [               Ictalurus punctatus               ]) held at two different temperatures (15.5 and 18.5°C) and sacrificed at regular intervals up to 120\,h from the time of ingestion to quantify the prey contents remaining in the digestive tract. We found that ration size, temperature, and predator species all influenced digestion rate, with some indication that ration size had the largest influence. DNA‐based analyses were able to identify salmon smolt prey in predator gut samples for much longer than visual analysis (\textasciitilde 12\,h for visual analysis vs. \textasciitilde 72\,h for molecular analyses). Our study provides evidence that modelling the persistence of prey DNA in predator guts for molecular diet analyses may be feasible using a small set of controlling variables for many fish systems.},

Despite the increasing number of eDNA metabarcoding approaches, the ability to quantify species biomass and abundance in natural systems is still not fully understood. Previous studies have shown positive but sometimes weak correlations between abundance estimates from eDNA metabarcoding data and from conventional capture methods. As both methods have independent biases a lack of concordance is difficult to interpret. Here we tested whether read counts from eDNA metabarcoding provide accurate quantitative estimates of the absolute abundance of fish in holding ponds with known fish biomass and number of individuals. Environmental DNA samples were collected from two fishery ponds with high fish density and broad species diversity. In one pond, two different DNA capture strategies (on-site filtration with enclosed filters and three different preservation buffers versus lab filtration using open filters) were used to evaluate their performance in relation to fish community composition and biomass/abundance estimates. Fish species read counts were significantly correlated with both biomass and abundance, and this result, together with information on fish diversity, was repeatable when open or enclosed filters with different preservation buffers were used. This research demonstrates that eDNA metabarcoding provides accurate qualitative and quantitative information on fish communities in small ponds, and results are consistent between different methods of DNA capture. This method flexibility will be beneficial for future eDNA-based fish monitoring and their integration into fisheries management.},

Conventional methods used to monitor these events are often unable to assess the spawning activity directly or can be invasive and therefore problematic. This is especially the case when threatened fish populations are the study subject, such as the Arctic charr (               Salvelinus alpinus               L.) populations in Windermere (Cumbria, UK). Arctic charr populations have been studied in this lake since the 1940s, and the locations and characteristics of spawning grounds have been described in detail using techniques such as hydroacoustics, as well as physical and visual surveys of the lake bottom. Here, in conjunction with established netting surveys, we added an environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding approach to assess the spatial distribution of Arctic charr in the lake throughout the year to test whether this tool could allow us to identify spawning locations and activity. Sampling was carried out between October 2017 and July 2018 at three locations in the lake, covering putative and known spawning sites. eDNA metabarcoding provided accurate spatial and temporal characterization of Arctic charr spawning events. Peaks of Arctic charr relative read counts from eDNA metabarcoding were observed during the spawning season and at specific locations of both putative and known spawning sites. Net catches of mature Arctic charr individuals confirmed the association between the Arctic charr spawning activity and the peaks of eDNA metabarcoding relative read counts. This study demonstrates the ability of eDNA metabarcoding to effectively and efficiently characterize the spatial and temporal nature of fish spawning in lentic systems.},

Concern has been raised about the methods presently used to establish the abundance indices and about the catching efficiency of the trawl for the smaller-sized fish. The data have been reviewed for the period 1980-2002 and new abundance indices and length distributions of northeast Arctic cod (Gadus morhua), northeast Arctic haddock (Melanogrammus aeglefinus), capelin (Mallotus villosus), Norwegian spring spawning herring (Clupea harengus), and redfish (Sebastes spp.) were estimated. The abundance indices were estimated by two different statistical techniques, the method of stratified sample mean and a method based on the lognormal theory. The latter method was concluded to be the preferred one for this particular survey. The poor catching efficiency of smaller cod and haddock was corrected for and the results showed that length dependent selection contributes to a serious bias in the estimates when not corrected for, and it is likely that selection will bias the estimates for the other species as well. It is recommended that the technique based on the lognormal theory and with length corrections becomes the new standard method for estimating abundance indices from the 0-group survey in the Barents Sea. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract = {Abstract             Environmental DNA (eDNA) analysis allows~the simultaneous examination of organisms across multiple trophic levels and domains of life, providing critical information about the complex biotic interactions related to ecosystem change. Here we used multilocus amplicon sequencing of eDNA to survey biodiversity from an eighteen-month (2015–2016) time-series of seawater samples from Monterey Bay, California. The resulting dataset encompasses 663 taxonomic groups (at Family or higher taxonomic rank) ranging from microorganisms to mammals. We inferred changes in the composition of communities, revealing putative interactions among taxa and identifying correlations between these communities and environmental properties over time. Community network analysis provided evidence of expected predator-prey relationships, trophic linkages, and seasonal shifts across all domains of life. We conclude that eDNA-based analyses can provide detailed information about marine ecosystem dynamics and identify sensitive biological indicators that can suggest ecosystem changes and inform conservation strategies.},

Although eDNA metabarcoding enables a rapid assessment of biodiversity, it is prone to species detection errors that may occur at sequential steps in field sampling, laboratory experiments, and bioinformatics. In this study, we illustrate how the error rates in the eDNA metabarcoding-based species detection can be accounted for by applying the multispecies occupancy modelling framework. We report a case study with the eDNA sample from an aquarium tank in which the detection probabilities of species in the two major steps of eDNA metabarcoding, filtration and PCR, across a range of PCR annealing temperatures, were examined. We also show that the results can be used to examine the efficiency of species detection under a given experimental design and setting, in terms of the efficiency of species detection, highlighting the usefulness of the multispecies site occupancy modelling framework to study the optimum conditions for molecular experiments.},

Understanding population dynamics of endemic species is needed to maintain or restore their populations. Advancements in models that describe population dynamics of endemic species and species of conservation need has been made possible by the application of novel quantitative methods. One such modeling tool is state-space modeling. These models provide a flexible framework to describe population dynamics using simple mortality models and more complex integrated population models. Here we develop a state-space model to describe survival and population size of the Sicklefin Redhorse (Catostomidae:               Moxostoma               sp.), a species of conservation concern from two rivers located in North Carolina, USA. This model is structured to combine information across similar rivers and to account for complex interactions of sex, time, variable sampling effort, and river discharge. Survival of Sicklefin Redhorse was found to vary by sex, and annual variability was not consistent across rivers. Discharge was negatively related to capture probability for males. Capture probabilities also differed across sex. Population estimates revealed a large difference between sex where males outnumbered females each year in both rivers. We conclude that electrofishing is not an efficient capture method but when used, should consider discharge. Discharge was not included in the survival model, however, the 3 years with the lowest survival in the Little Tennessee River coincided with the three lowest discharge years in the time series. Future work should investigate the difference in survival between the rivers.},

The sediment below active aquaculture farms receives inputs of organic matter from uneaten food and faecal material and this has led to concerns related to environmental sustainability. The impacts of organic enrichment on macrobenthic infauna are well characterized; however, much less is known about effect on bacterial communities. In this study, sediment, macrobenthic infauna samples and environmental data were collected along an enrichment gradient radiating out from a Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) farm (Marlborough Sounds; New Zealand). DNA and RNA were extracted and 16S rRNA metabarcodes from bacterial communities characterized using high-throughput sequencing. Desulfobacterales dominated at the cage (DNA and RNA), and at sites 50 m (DNA and RNA) and 150 m (RNA) from the farm. In contrast, unclassified bacteria from the class Gammaproteobacteria were the most abundant taxa at control sites (625 and 4000 m). Pronounced differences among DNA and RNA samples occurred at the cage site where Desulfobacterales abundance was markedly higher in RNA samples. There were strong correlations between shifts in bacterial communities and total organic matter and redox. This suggests that bacterial composition is strongly influenced by organic enrichment, a trait that may make them useful for assessing impacts associated with aquaculture farms.},

  abstract = {Future CO2-induced climate change scenarios from Global Circulation Models (GCMs) indicate increasing air temperatures, with the greatest warming in the Arctic and Subarctic. Changes to the wind fields and precipitation patterns are also suggested. These will lead to changes in the hydrographic properties of the ocean, as well as the vertical stratification and circulation patterns. Of particular note is the expected increase in ocean temperature. Based upon the observed responses of cod to temperature variability, the expected responses of cod stocks throughout the North Atlantic to the future temperature scenarios are reviewed and discussed here. Stocks in the Celtic and Irish Seas are expected to disappear under predicted temperature changes by the year 2100, while those in the southern North Sea and Georges Bank will decline. Cod will likely spread northwards along the coasts of Greenland and Labrador, occupy larger areas of the Barents Sea, and may even extend onto some of the continental shelves of the Arctic Ocean. In addition, spawning sites will be established further north than currently. It is likely that spring migrations will occur earlier, and fall returns will be later. There is the distinct possibility that, where seasonal sea ice disappears altogether, cod will cease their migration. Individual growth rates for many of the cod stocks will increase, leading to an overall increase in the total production of Atlantic cod in the North Atlantic. These responses of cod to future climate changes are highly uncertain, however, as they will also depend on the changes to climate and oceanographic variables besides temperature, such as plankton production, the prey and predator fields, and industrial fishing. © 2005 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.

Here we evaluate a suite of environmental DNA (eDNA) markers coupled with next generation sequencing (NGS) that span the tree of life, comparing them with traditional biodiversity monitoring tools within ten 20 × 20 meter plots along a 700 meter elevational gradient. Results: From six eDNA datasets (one from each of 16S, 18S, ITS, trnL and two from COI) we identified sequences from 109 NCBI taxonomy-defined phyla or equivalent, ranging from 31 to 60 for a given eDNA marker. Estimates of alpha and gamma diversity were sensitive to the number of sequence reads, whereas beta diversity estimates were less sensitive. The average within-plot beta diversity was lower than between plots for all markers. The soil beta diversity of COI and 18S markers showed the strongest response to the elevational variation of the eDNA markers (COI: r = 0.49, p {$<$} 0.001; 18S: r = 0.48, p {$<$} 0.001). Furthermore pairwise beta diversities for these two markers were strongly correlated with those calculated from traditional vegetation and invertebrate biodiversity measures. Conclusions: Using a soil-based eDNA approach, we demonstrate that standard phylogenetic markers are capable of recovering sequences from a broad diversity of eukaryotes, in addition to prokaryotes by 16S. The COI and 18S eDNA markers are the best proxies for aboveground biodiversity based on the high correlation between the pairwise beta diversities of these markers and those obtained using traditional methods.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a new and simple method to find indicator species and species assemblages characterizing groups of sites. The novelty of our approach lies in the way we combine a species relative abundance with its relative frequency of occurrence in the various groups of sites. This index is maximum when all individuals of a species are found in a single group of sites and when the species occurs in all sites of that group; it is a symmetric indicator. The statistical significance of the species indicator values is evaluated using a randomization procedure. Contrary to TWINSPAN, our indicator index for a given species is independent of the other species relative abundances, and there is no need to use pseudospecies. The new method identifies indicator species for typologies of species releves obtained by any hierarchical or nonhierarchical classification procedure; its use is independent of the classification method. Because indicator species give ecological meaning to groups of sites, this method provides criteria to compare typologies, to identify where to stop dividing clusters into subsets, and to point out the main levels in a hierarchical classification of sites. Species can be grouped on the basis of their indicator values for each clustering level, the heterogeneous nature of species assemblages observed in any one site being well preserved. Such assemblages are usually a mixture of eurytopic (higher level) and stenotopic species (characteristic of lower level clusters). The species assemblage approach demonstrates the importance of the 'sampled patch size,' i.e., the diversity of sampled ecological combinations, when we compare the frequencies of core and Satellite species. A new way to present species-site tables, accounting for the hierarchical relationships among species, is proposed. A large data set of carabid beetle distributions in open habitats of Belgium is used as a case study to illustrate the new method.},

Here, we assessed the effect of four metal ions (Ca               2+               , Fe               3+               , Mn               2+               , Cu               2+               ) present in marine sediments on DNA detectability for both the extraction and the PCR detection steps. A single metal ion and exogenous DNA were added to marine sediments treated chemically to remove inhibitors. Our results showed that natural concentrations of calcium, iron, and manganese ions in surface marine sediments can impede completely DNA detections. Alternatively, copper ions added to the matrix increased DNA detectability by 7.7\%. We also observed bimodal inhibitory effects of calcium and iron ions on DNA detectability, suggesting that the extraction and the PCR steps are both affected. Our findings highlight new limitations of eDNA detections. Avenues to optimize eDNA detection protocols applicable to multiple matrices are discussed.},

  abstract = {Although environmental DNA (eDNA) has been used to infer the presence of rare aquatic species, many facets of this technique remain unresolved. In particular, the relationship between eDNA and fish distribution is not known. We examined the relationship between the distribution of fish and their eDNA (detection rate and concentration) in a lake. A quantitative PCR (qPCR) assay for a region within the cytochrome b gene of the common carp (Cyprinus carpio or 'carp'), an ubiquitous invasive fish, was developed and used to measure eDNA in Lake Staring (MN, USA), in which both the density of carp and their distribution have been closely monitored for several years. Surface water, sub-surface water, and sediment were sampled from 22 locations in the lake, including areas frequently used by carp. In water, areas of high carp use had a higher rate of detection and concentration of eDNA, but there was no effect of fish use on sediment eDNA. The detection rate and concentration of eDNA in surface and sub-surface water were not significantly different (p≥0.5), indicating that eDNA did not accumulate in surface water. The detection rate followed the trend: high-use water {$>$} low-use water {$>$} sediment. The concentration of eDNA in sediment samples that were above the limit of detection were several orders of magnitude greater than water on a per mass basis, but a poor limit of detection led to low detection rates. The patchy distribution of eDNA in the water of our study lake suggests that the mechanisms that remove eDNA from the water column, such as decay and sedimentation, are rapid. Taken together, these results indicate that effective eDNA sampling methods should be informed by fish distribution, as eDNA concentration was shown to vary dramatically between samples taken less than 100 m apart.},

  abstract = {Mapping trawling pressure on the benthic habitats is needed as background to support an ecosystem approach to fisheries management. The extent and intensity of bottom trawling on the European continental shelf (0–1000 m) was analysed from logbook statistics and vessel monitoring system data for 2010–2012 at a grid cell resolution of 1 × 1\,min longitude and latitude. Trawling intensity profiles with seabed impact at the surface and subsurface level are presented for 14 management areas in the North-east Atlantic, Baltic Sea and Mediterranean Sea. The footprint of the management areas ranged between 53–99\% and 6–94\% for the depth zone from 0 to 200 m (Shallow) and from 201 to 1000 m (Deep), respectively. The footprint was estimated as the total area of all grid cells that were trawled fully or partially. Excluding the untrawled proportions reduced the footprint estimates to 28–85\% and 2–77\%. Largest footprints per unit landings were observed off Portugal and in the Mediterranean Sea. Mean trawling intensity ranged between 0.5 and 8.5 times per year, but was less in the Deep zone with a maximum intensity of 6.4. Highest intensities were recorded in the Skagerrak-Kattegat, Iberian Portuguese area, Tyrrhenian Sea and Adriatic Sea. Bottom trawling was highly aggregated. For the Shallow zone the seabed area where 90\% of the effort occurred comprised between 17\% and 63\% (median 36\%) of the management area. Footprints were high over a broad range of soft sediment habitats. Using the longevity distribution of the untrawled infaunal community, the seabed integrity was estimated as the proportion of the biomass of benthic taxa where the trawling interval at the subsurface level exceeds their life span. Seabed integrity was low (\&lt;0.1) in large parts of the European continental shelfs, although smaller pockets of seabed with higher integrity values occur. The methods developed here integrate official fishing effort statistics and industry-based gear information to provide high-resolution pressure maps and indicators, which greatly improve the basis for assessing and managing benthic pressure from bottom trawling. Further they provide quantitative estimates of trawling impact on a continuous scale by which managers can steer.},

  abstract = {Metabarcoding is an emerging genetic tool to rapidly assess biodiversity in ecosystems. It involves high-throughput sequencing of a standard gene from an environmental sample and comparison to a reference database. However, no consensus has emerged regarding laboratory pipelines to screen species diversity and infer species abundances from environmental samples. In particular, the effect of primer bias and the detection limit for specimens with a low biomass has not been systematically examined, when processing samples in bulk. We developed and tested a DNA metabarcoding protocol that utilises the standard cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) barcoding fragment to detect freshwater macroinvertebrate taxa. DNA was extracted in bulk, amplified in a single PCR step, and purified, and the libraries were directly sequenced in two independent MiSeq runs (300-bp paired-end reads). Specifically, we assessed the influence of specimen biomass on sequence read abundance by sequencing 31 specimens of a stonefly species with known haplotypes spanning three orders of magnitude in biomass (experiment I). Then, we tested the recovery of 52 different freshwater invertebrate taxa of similar biomass using the same standard barcoding primers (experiment II). Each experiment was replicated ten times to maximise statistical power. The results of both experiments were consistent across replicates. We found a distinct positive correlation between species biomass and resulting numbers of MiSeq reads. Furthermore, we reliably recovered 83\% of the 52 taxa used to test primer bias. However, sequence abundance varied by four orders of magnitudes between taxa despite the use of similar amounts of biomass. Our metabarcoding approach yielded reliable results for high-throughput assessments. However, the results indicated that primer efficiency is highly species-specific, which would prevent straightforward assessments of species abundance and biomass in a sample. Thus, PCR-based metabarcoding assessments of biodiversity should rely on presence-absence metrics.},

  abstract = {Environmental DNA (eDNA) is increasingly used to measure biodiversity of marine ecosystems, yet key aspects of the temporal dynamics of eDNA remain unknown. Of particular interest is in situ persistence of eDNA signals in dynamic marine environments, as eDNA degradation rates have predominantly been quantified through mesocosm studies. To determine in situ eDNA residence times, we introduced an eDNA signal from a non-native fish into a protected bay of a Southern California rocky reef ecosystem, and then measured changes in both introduced and background eDNA signals across a fixed transect over 96 hours. Foreign eDNA signal was no longer detected only 7.5 hours after introduction, a time substantially shorter than the multi-day persistence times in laboratory studies. Moreover, the foreign eDNA signal spread along the entire 38 m transect within 1.5 hours after introduction, indicating that transport and diffusion play a role in eDNA detectability even in protected low energy marine environments. Similarly, native vertebrate eDNA signals varied greatly over the 96 hours of observation as well as within two additional nearby fixed transects sampled over 120 hours. While community structure did significantly change across time of day and tidal direction, neither accounted for the majority of observed variation. Combined, results show that both foreign and native eDNA signatures can exhibit substantial temporal heterogeneity, even on hourly time scales. Further work exploring eDNA decay from lagrangian perspective and quantifying effects of sample and technical replication are needed to better understand temporal variation of eDNA signatures in nearshore marine environments.},

These species vary seasonally in distribution and abundance due to environmental conditions such as precipitation and temperature. Monitoring this seasonal movement is important for management to control the population size and spread of the species. We examined if environmental DNA (eDNA) approaches could detect seasonal changes of these species. To do this, we developed a novel genetic marker that was able to both detect and differentiate bighead and silver carp DNA. We used the marker, combined with a novel occupancy model, to study the occurrence of bigheaded carps at 3 sites on the Wabash River over the course of a year. We studied the Wabash River because of concerns that carps may be able to use the system to invade the Great Lakes via a now closed (ca. 2017) connection at Eagle Marsh between the Wabash River's watershed and the Great Lakes’ watershed. We found seasonal trends in the probability of detection and occupancy that varied across sites. These findings demonstrate that eDNA methods can detect seasonal changes in bigheaded carps densities and suggest that the amount of eDNA present changes seasonally. The site that was farthest upstream and had the lowest carp densities exhibited the strongest seasonal trends for both detection probabilities and sample occupancy probabilities. Furthermore, other observations suggest that carps seasonally leave this site, and we were able to detect this with our eDNA approach.},

Environmental DNA (eDNA) analysis is a commonly used method to determine species presence and distribution. However, when understanding eDNA-based distribution data, managers must contend with imperfect detection in collection samples and subsamples (i.e., molecular analyses) impacting their ability to detect species and estimate occurrence. Occurrence models can estimate 3 probabilities: occurrence, capture, and eDNA detection. However, most occurrence models do not. To quantify imperfect detection in rare versus common species, we examined multiple field capture and detection probabilities. We studied this with 3 objectives: Determine sample sizes required to detect eDNA given imperfect detection, determine sample sizes required to estimate eDNA capture parameters, and examine performance of a 3-level occurrence model. We found detecting eDNA in ≥1 sample at a site required ≤15 samples per site for common species, but detecting eDNA when looking for rare species required 45 to 90 samples per site. Our occurrence model recovered known parameters unless capture and detection probabilities were {$<$}0.2 where {$>$}100 samples per site and ≥8 molecular replicates were required.

This paper describes fluctuations in abundance and biomass indices of lumpfish based on pelagic trawl catches. This long-term monitoring survey has been conducted between August and September since 1980. Investigations show that lumpfish is widely distributed in the pelagic waters of the Barents Sea. Relative biomass and abundance indices were calculated for the period 1980–2012. The mean annual biomass was estimated to be 48 000 t, with a maximum of 143 000 t; the estimated mean annual abundance was 53 million individuals, with a maximum of 132 million individuals. There were more juveniles than adults, with juveniles comprising 40–80\% of the total abundance (average 60\%). The largest concentrations of both juveniles and adults were in years with warm temperatures. The majority of fish were found in waters of 5–7°C (60\% of juveniles) and 4–7°C (70\% of adults), indicating a strong association with Atlantic water masses in the Barents Sea. Regulations on the Norwegian and Russian fisheries for prespawning lumpfish are based only on after-the-fact fishery data and, therefore, have been insufficient in preventing negative effects on the lumpfish resource from fishing. Understanding the stock fluctuations and the use of fishery-independent data may improve the precautionary approach to fishery management. The use of lumpfish indices from the scientific surveys in the Barents Sea should be implemented to strengthen the current stock assessment.},

Here, we offer a pathway that can unite fishers, scientists, resource managers and conservationists towards a single vision for some areas of the ocean where small investments in management can offer disproportionately large benefits to fisheries and biodiversity conservation. Specifically, we provide a series of evidenced‐based arguments that support an urgent need to recognize fish spawning aggregations (               FSA               s) as a focal point for fisheries management and conservation on a global scale, with a particular emphasis placed on the protection of multispecies               FSA               sites. We illustrate that these sites serve as productivity hotspots – small areas of the ocean that are dictated by the interactions between physical forces and geomorphology, attract multiple species to reproduce in large numbers and support food web dynamics, ecosystem health and robust fisheries.               FSA               s are comparable in vulnerability, importance and magnificence to breeding aggregations of seabirds, sea turtles and whales yet they receive insufficient attention and are declining worldwide. Numerous case‐studies confirm that protected aggregations do recover to benefit fisheries through increases in fish biomass, catch rates and larval recruitment at fished sites. The small size and spatio‐temporal predictability of               FSA               s allow monitoring, assessment and enforcement to be scaled down while benefits of protection scale up to entire populations. Fishers intuitively understand the linkages between protecting               FSA               s and healthy fisheries and thus tend to support their protection.},

In this study, we explored an enhanced quantitative approach by metabarcoding whole zooplankton communities using a highly degenerate primer set for the mitochondrial marker cytochrome oxidase I and compared the results to biomass estimates obtained using the traditional morphological approach of processing zooplankton samples. As expected, detected species richness using the metabarcoding approach was 3–4 times higher compared to morphological processing, with the highest differences found in the meroplankton fraction. About 75\% of the species identified using microscopy were also recovered in the metabarcoding run. Within the taxa detected using both approaches, the relative numbers of sequence counts showed a strong quantitative relationship to their relative biomass, estimated from length-weight regressions, for a wide range of metazoan taxa. The highest correlations were found for crustaceans and the lowest for meroplanktonic larvae. Our results show that the reported approach of using a metabarcoding marker with improved taxonomic resolution, universal coverage for metazoans, reduced primer bias, and availability of a comprehensive reference database, allow for rapid and relatively inexpensive processing of hundreds of samples at a higher taxonomic resolution than traditional zooplankton sorting. The described approach can therefore be widely applied for monitoring or ecological studies.},

  abstract = {The invasive American bullfrog (Lithobates catesbeianus) imperils freshwater biodiversity worldwide. Effective management hinges on early detection of incipient invasions and subsequent rapid response, as established populations are extremely difficult to eradicate. Although environmental DNA (eDNA) detection methods provide a highly sensitive alternative to conventional surveillance techniques, extensive testing is imperative to generate reliable output. Here, we tested and compared the performance of two primer/probe assays to detect and quantify the abundance of bullfrogs in Western Europe in silico and in situ using digital droplet PCR (ddPCR). Although both assays proved to be equally target-specific and sensitive, one outperformed the other in ddPCR detection resolution (i.e., distinguishing groups of target-positive and target-negative droplets), and hence was selected for further analyses. Mesocosm experiments revealed that tadpole abundance and biomass explained 99\% of the variation in eDNA concentration. Because per individual eDNA emission rates did not differ significantly among tadpoles and juveniles, and adults mostly reside out of the water, eDNA concentration can be used as an approximation of local bullfrog abundance in natural populations. Seasonal eDNA patterns in three colonized ponds showed parallel fluctuations in bullfrog eDNA concentration. An increase in eDNA concentration was detected in spring, followed by a strong peak coinciding with the breeding season (August, September or October), and continuously low eDNA concentrations during winter. With this study, we report the validation process required for appropriately implementing eDNA barcoding analyses in lentic systems. We demonstrate that this technique can serve as a solid and reliable tool to detect the early stages of bullfrog invasions and to quantify temporal changes in abundance that will be useful in coordinating large-scale bullfrog eradication programs and evaluating their efficiency.},

Impacts of ocean acidification on marine fauna and ecosystem processes. – ICES Journal of Marine Science, 65: 414–432. Oceanic uptake of anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2) is altering the seawater chemistry of the world’s oceans with consequences for marine biota. Elevated partial pressure of CO2 (pCO2) is causing the calcium carbonate saturation horizon to shoal in many regions, particularly in high latitudes and regions that intersect with pronounced hypoxic zones. The ability of marine animals, most importantly pteropod molluscs, foraminifera, and some benthic invertebrates, to produce calcareous skeletal structures is directly affected by seawater CO2 chemistry. CO2 influences the physiology of marine organisms as well through acid-base imbalance and reduced oxygen transport capacity. The few studies at relevant pCO2 levels impede our ability to predict future impacts on foodweb dynamics and other ecosystem processes. Here we present new observations, review available data, and identify priorities for future research, based on regions, ecosystems, taxa, and physiological processes believed to be most vulnerable to ocean acidification. We conclude that ocean acidification and the synergistic impacts of other anthropogenic stressors provide great potential for widespread changes to marine ecosystems.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Effective conservation requires understanding species’ abundance patterns and demographic rates across space and time. Ideally, such knowledge should be available for whole communities because variation in species’ dynamics can elucidate factors leading to biodiversity losses. However, collecting data to simultaneously estimate abundance and demographic rates of communities of species is often prohibitively time intensive and expensive. We developed a multispecies dynamic               N               ‐occupancy model to estimate unbiased, community‐wide relative abundance and demographic rates. In this model, detection–nondetection data (e.g., repeated presence–absence surveys) are used to estimate species‐ and community‐level parameters and the effects of environmental factors. To validate our model, we conducted a simulation study to determine how and when such an approach can be valuable and found that our multispecies model outperformed comparable single‐species models in estimating abundance and demographic rates in many cases. Using data from a network of camera traps across tropical equatorial Africa, we then used our model to evaluate the statuses and trends of a forest‐dwelling antelope community. We estimated relative abundance, rates of recruitment (i.e., reproduction and immigration), and apparent survival probabilities for each species’ local population. The antelope community was fairly stable (although 17\% of populations [species–park combinations] declined over the study period). Variation in apparent survival was linked more closely to differences among national parks than to individual species’ life histories. The multispecies dynamic               N               ‐occupancy model requires only detection–nondetection data to evaluate the population dynamics of multiple sympatric species and can thus be a valuable tool for examining the reasons behind recent biodiversity loss.                        ,              Resumen                            La conservación efectiva requiere del entendimiento de los patrones de abundancia de las especies a lo largo del tiempo y el espacio. Sería ideal que dicho conocimiento estuviera disponible para todas las comunidades ya que la variación en la dinámica de las especies puede esclarecer los factores que llevan a la pérdida de la biodiversidad. Sin embargo, la recolección de información para estimar simultáneamente las tasas demográficas y de abundancia de las comunidades de especies con frecuencia es cara y consume tiempo. Desarrollamos un modelo multiespecies dinámico de ocupación‐               N               para estimar la tasa demográfica y de abundancia relativas sin sesgos y en toda la comunidad. En este modelo usamos información de detección‐no detección (p. ej.: censos repetidos de presencia‐ausencia) para estimar los parámetros a nivel comunitario y de especie y los efectos de los factores ambientales. Para validar nuestro modelo, realizamos un estudio de simulación para determinar cómo y cuándo dicha estrategia puede ser valiosa y descubrimos que nuestro modelo multiespecies superó a los modelos comparables de una sola especie en la estimación de las tasas demográficas y de abundancia en muchos casos. Usamos nuestro modelo con datos de una red de cámaras trampa ubicadas a lo largo de África ecuatorial para evaluar los estados y tendencias de una comunidad forestal de antílopes. Estimamos la abundancia relativa, tasa de reclutamiento (es decir, reproducción e inmigración) y las probabilidades de supervivencia aparente para la población local de cada especie. La comunidad de antílopes fue bastante estable (aunque el 17\% de las poblaciones [combinaciones especie‐parque] declinaron durante el periodo de estudio). La variación en la supervivencia aparente estuvo vinculada con mayor cercanía a las diferencias entre los parques nacionales que a la historia de vida de cada especie individual. El modelo multiespecies dinámico de ocupación‐               N               requiere solamente información de detección‐no detección para evaluar las dinámicas poblacionales de muchas especies simpátricas y por lo tanto puede ser una herramienta valiosa para examinar las razones detrás de la pérdida reciente de la biodiversidad.},

The new patterns and forms of migration seen among East European migrants in the West - in terms of circular and temporary free movement, informal labour market incorporation, cultures of migration, transnational networks, and other phenomena documented in the following papers - illustrate the emergence of a new migration system in Europe. Textbook narratives, in terms of standard accounts of immigration, integration and citizenship based on models of post-colonial, guestworker and asylum migration, will need to be rethought. One particularly fertile source for this is the large body of theory and research developed in the study of Mexican-US migration, itself a part of a regional integration process of comparative relevance to the new European context. While the benefits of open migration from the East will likely triumph over populist political hostility, it is a system that may encourage an exploitative dual labour market for Eastern movers working in the West, as well as encouraging a more effective racial or ethnically-based closure to immigrants from South of the Mediterranean and further afield.},

However, several species are difficult to detect, especially during particular time periods or developmental stages, potentially biasing study outcomes. Here we present a novel approach, based on the limited persistence of DNA in the environment, to detect the presence of a species in fresh water. We used specific primers that amplify short mitochondrial DNA sequences to track the presence of a frog (               Rana catesbeiana               ) in controlled environments and natural wetlands. A multi-sampling approach allowed for species detection in all environments where it was present, even at low densities. The reliability of the results was demonstrated by the identification of amplified DNA fragments, using traditional sequencing and parallel pyrosequencing techniques. As the environment can retain the molecular imprint of inhabiting species, our approach allows the reliable detection of secretive organisms in wetlands without direct observation. Combined with massive sequencing and the development of DNA barcodes that enable species identification, this approach opens new perspectives for the assessment of current biodiversity from environmental samples.},

  abstract = {Predicting the distribution of endangered species from habitat data is frequently perceived to be a useful technique. Models that predict the presence or absence of a species are normally judged by the number of prediction errors. These may be of two types: false positives and false negatives. Many of the prediction errors can be traced to ecological processes such as unsaturated habitat and species interactions. Consequently, if prediction errors are not placed in an ecological context the results of the model may be misleading. The simplest, and most widely used, measure of prediction accuracy is the number of correctly classified cases. There are other measures of prediction success that may be more appropriate. Strategies for assessing the causes and costs of these errors are discussed. A range of techniques for measuring error in presence/absence models, including some that are seldom used by ecologists (e.g. ROC plots and cost matrices), are described. A new approach to estimating prediction error, which is based on the spatial characteristics of the errors, is proposed. Thirteen recommendations are made to enable the objective selection of an error assessment technique for ecological presence/absence models.},

Presence–absence or count data collected in systematic, planned surveys are more reliable but typically less abundant.                                                     We proposed a probabilistic model to allow for joint analysis of presence‐only and survey data to exploit their complementary strengths. Our method pools presence‐only and presence–absence data for many species and maximizes a joint likelihood, simultaneously estimating and adjusting for the sampling bias affecting the presence‐only data. By assuming that the sampling bias is the same for all species, we can borrow strength across species to efficiently estimate the bias and improve our inference from presence‐only data.                                                     We evaluate our model's performance on data for 36 eucalypt species in south‐eastern Australia. We find that presence‐only records exhibit a strong sampling bias towards the coast and towards Sydney, the largest city. Our data‐pooling technique substantially improves the out‐of‐sample predictive performance of our model when the amount of available presence–absence data for a given species is scarce                                                     If we have only presence‐only data and no presence–absence data for a given species, but both types of data for several other species that suffer from the same spatial sampling bias, then our method can obtain an unbiased estimate of the first species' geographic range.},

  abstract = {The perception that ecosystem-based fishery management is too complex and poorly defined remains a primary impediment to its broadscale adoption and implementation. Here, I attempt to offer potential solutions to these concerns. Specifically, I focus on pathways that can contribute to overall simplification by moving toward integrated place-based management plans and away from large numbers of species-based plans; by using multispecies or ecosystem models and indicators that permit the simultaneous and consistent assessment of ecosystem components while also incorporating broader environmental factors; and by consolidating individual administrative and regulatory functions now mostly dealt with on a species-by-species basis into a more integrated framework for system-wide decision-making. The approach focuses on emergent properties at the community and ecosystem levels and seeks to identify simpler modeling and analysis tools for evaluation. Adoption of ecosystem-based management procedures relying on simple decision rules and metrics is advocated. It is recommended that we replace static concepts for individual species focusing on maximum sustainable yield with a dynamic ecosystem yield framework that involves setting system-wide reference points along with constraints to protect individual species, habitats, and nontarget organisms in a dynamic environmental setting.},

In this paper, we use second-generation sequencing to unmask putatively diverse marine metazoan biodiversity in a Scottish temperate benthic ecosystem. We show that remarkable differences in diversity occurred at microgeographical scales and refute currently accepted ecological and taxonomic paradigms of meiofaunal identity, rank abundance and concomitant understanding of trophic dynamics. Richness estimates from the current benchmarked Operational Clustering of Taxonomic Units from Parallel UltraSequencing analyses are broadly aligned with those derived from morphological assessments. However, the slope of taxon rarefaction curves for many phyla remains incomplete, suggesting that the true alpha diversity is likely to exceed current perceptions. The approaches provide a rapid, objective and cost-effective taxonomic framework for exploring links between ecosystem structure and function of all hitherto intractable, but ecologically important, communities. © 2010 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

The authors tested the effect of PCR replicates, different polymerase mixes and amplicon GC content on diversity estimates. Results show that occurrence data was not biased for any of the parameters tested and only insufficient PCR replicates could impair the detection of rare taxa. For abundance data, polymerases were found to differentially bias estimates of the relative amplicon abundances and this depended on GC content.},

In addition to studying the chemical and physical characteristics of the area (i.e., currents and sediment analyses), some biological analyses were also performed. The AZTI's Marine Biotic Index (AMBI) and the multivariate AMBI (M-AMBI) were calculated, which are being used in assessing the ecological status of benthic communities within the European Water Framework Directive (WFD). Clear impact gradients were detected according to both methods; they are related to farm production, prevailing currents, and characteristics of the area (i.e., water depth and distance to the cages). The site affected most was detected within 84 m from the cages; the area that no longer showed effects was over 907 m from the cages. The gradient is shown by decreasing AMBI values and percentage of opportunistic species and increasing richness, diversity, and the presence of sensitive species. This study highlights the importance of setting reference conditions for different areas when calculating M-AMBI. These reference conditions correspond to those in undisturbed sites in the opposite direction of the prevailing currents within the area. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

We focus on the production stages of salmon farming-freshwater hatcheries used to produce smolts and marine grow-out sites using open netpens. Specifically, we propose two impact categories: impacts of nutrient release and impacts on biodiversity. Proposed indicators for impacts of nutrient release are (1) the area altered by farm waste, (2) changes in nutrient concentration in the water column, (3) the percent of carrying capacity reached, (4) the percent of total anthropogenic nutrient release, and (5) release of wastes into freshwater. Proposed indicators for impacts on biodiversity are (1) the number of escaped salmon, (2) the number of reported disease outbreaks, (3) parasite abundance on farms, and (4) the percent reduction in wild salmon survival. For each proposed indicator, an example of how the indicator could be estimated is given and the strengths and weaknesses of that indicator are discussed. We propose that including local environmental impacts as well as global-scale ones in LCA allows us to better identify potential trade-offs, where actions that are beneficial at one scale are harmful at another, and synchronicities, where actions have desirable or undesirable effects at both spatial scales. We also discuss the potential applicability of meta-analytic statistical techniques to LCA. © 2012 by Yale University.},

  abstract = {The rapid evolution of environmental (e)DNA methods has resulted in knowledge gaps in smaller, yet critical details like proper use of negative controls to detect contamination. Detecting contamination is vital for confident use of eDNA results in decision-making. We conducted two literature reviews to summarize (a) the types of quality assurance measures taken to detect contamination of eDNA samples from aquatic environments, (b) the occurrence, frequency and attribution (i.e., putative sources) of unexpected amplification in these quality assurance samples, and (c) how results were interpreted when contamination occurred. In the first literature review, we reviewed 156 papers and found that 91\% of targeted and 73\% of metabarcoding eDNA studies reported inclusion of negative controls within their workflows. However, a large percentage of targeted (49\%) and metabarcoding (80\%) studies only reported negative controls for laboratory procedures, so results were potentially blind to field contamination. Many of the 156 studies did not provide critical methodological information and amplification results of negative controls. In our second literature review, we reviewed 695 papers and found that 30 targeted and 32 metabarcoding eDNA studies reported amplification of negative controls. This amplification occurred at similar proportions for field and lab workflow steps in targeted and metabarcoding studies. These studies most frequently used amplified negative controls to delimit a detection threshold above which is considered significant or provided rationale for why the unexpected amplifications did not affect results. In summary, we found that there has been minimal convergence over time on negative control implementation, methods, and interpretation, which suggests that increased rigor in these smaller, yet critical details remains an outstanding need. We conclude our review by highlighting several studies that have developed especially effective quality assurance, control and mitigation methods.},

Moreover, these methods are selective, targeting a subset of species at the time, and can be inaccessible to certain areas. Here, we used environmental DNA (eDNA), the DNA present in the water column as part of shed cells, tissues, or mucus, to provide comprehensive information about fish diversity in a large marine area. Further, eDNA results were compared to the fish diversity obtained in pelagic trawls. A total of 44 5~L-water samples were collected onboard a wide-scale oceanographic survey covering about 120,000 square kilometers in Northeast Atlantic Ocean. A short region of the 12S rRNA gene was amplified and sequenced through metabarcoding generating almost 3.5 million quality-filtered reads. Trawl and eDNA samples resulted in the same most abundant species (European anchovy, European pilchard, Atlantic mackerel, and blue whiting), but eDNA metabarcoding resulted in more detected bony fish and elasmobranch species (116) than trawling (16). Although an overall correlation between fishes biomass and number of reads was observed, some species deviated from the common trend, which could be explained by inherent biases of each of the methods. Species distribution patterns inferred from eDNA metabarcoding data coincided with current ecological knowledge of the species, suggesting that eDNA has the potential to draw sound ecological conclusions that can contribute to fish surveillance programs. Our results support eDNA metabarcoding for broad-scale marine fish diversity monitoring in the context of Directives such as the Common Fisheries Policy or the Marine Strategy Framework Directive.},

Taking account of catchability in groundfish survey trawls: implications for estimating demersal fish biomass. – ICES Journal of Marine Science, 64. Groundfish surveys are a key component of current scientific data monitoring and data-collection activities undertaken in support of fisheries management. Recent requirements to develop and implement an ecosystem approach to management are placing increasing and varied demands on such datasets. Successfully incorporating ecosystem and environmental objectives within fisheries management will, for example, require greater understanding of foodweb trophodynamics, which in turn requires detailed information on the abundance and distribution of fish predators and prey species on spatial scales hitherto rarely considered. However, no trawl gear catches all the fish in its path, so density estimates provided by such trawl samples do not reflect true densities of fish. Catchability in a trawl gear is affected by many factors and varies both between species and between different sized conspecifics, and therefore has the capacity to confound our understanding of predator–prey interactions and of the relative abundance of different species and size classes of fish at any point in time or space. To overcome such problems, estimates of the catchability of each size class of each species sampled in a given survey are required for trawl sample densities to be raised to the actual densities of fish present at each location sampled. Here, we present a method for estimating catchability coefficients for 1-cm size classes of fish species sampled by the Grande Overture Vertical trawl during the third quarter ICES International Bottom Trawl Survey. The catchability coefficients obtained are applied to survey data collected between 1998 and 2004 to examine annual variation in actual abundance of the demersal fish assemblage in the North Sea.},

Here, we analyze the response of benthic foraminifera communities cultured in mesocosm and exposed to different concentrations of Hg. Standard morphological analyses and environmental DNA metabarcoding show evidence that Hg pollution has detrimental effects on benthic foraminifera. The molecular analysis provides a more complete view of foraminiferal communities including the soft-walled single-chambered monothalamiids and small-sized hard-shelled rotaliids and textulariids than the morphological one. Among these taxa that are typically overlooked in morphological studies we found potential bioindicators of Hg pollution. The mesocosm approach proves to be an effective method to study benthic foraminiferal responses to various types and concentrations of pollutants over time. This study further supports foraminiferal metabarcoding as a complementary and/or alternative method to standard biomonitoring program based on the morphological identification of species communities.},

  abstract = {Molecular analysis of DNA left in the environment, known as environmental DNA (eDNA), has proven to be a powerful and cost-effective approach to infer occurrence of species. Nonetheless, relating measurements of eDNA concentration to population abundance remains difficult because detailed knowledge on the processes that govern spatial and temporal distribution of eDNA should be integrated to reconstruct the underlying distribution and abundance of a target species. In this study, we propose a general framework of abundance estimation for aquatic systems on the basis of spatially replicated measurements of eDNA. The proposed method explicitly accounts for production, transport and degradation of eDNA by utilizing numerical hydrodynamic models that can simulate the distribution of eDNA concentrations within an aquatic area. It turns out that, under certain assumptions, population abundance can be estimated via a Bayesian inference of a generalized linear model. Application to a Japanese jack mackerel (Trachurus japonicus) population in Maizuru Bay revealed that the proposed method gives an estimate of population abundance comparable to that of a quantitative echo sounder method. Furthermore, the method successfully identified a source of exogenous input of eDNA (a fish market), which may render a quantitative application of eDNA difficult to interpret unless its effect is taken into account. These findings indicate the ability of eDNA to reliably reflect population abundance of aquatic macroorganisms; when the “ecology of eDNA” is adequately accounted for, population abundance can be quantified on the basis of measurements of eDNA concentration.},

Attempts to model exploited marine ecosystems can increase understanding of system dynamics; identify major processes, drivers and responses; highlight major gaps in knowledge; and provide a mechanism to ‘road test’ management strategies before implementing them in reality. The Atlantis modelling framework has been used in these roles for a decade and is regularly being modified and applied to new questions (e.g. it is being coupled to climate, biophysical and economic models to help consider climate change impacts, monitoring schemes and multiple use management). This study describes some common lessons learned from its implementation, particularly in regard to when these tools are most effective and the likely form of best practices for ecosystem‐based management (EBM). Most importantly, it highlighted that no single management lever is sufficient to address the many trade‐offs associated with EBM and that the mix of measures needed to successfully implement EBM will differ between systems and will change through time. Although it is doubtful that any single management action will be based solely on Atlantis, this modelling approach continues to provide important insights for managers when making natural resource management decisions.},

From 1982 to 1987, 16 oceanographic cruises were carried out along the Pacific coast of Baja California Sur, Mexico. Larvae of 42 mesopelagic fish taxa were collected.

These ecosystems host a large number of eukaryotes with diverse taxonomic and functional diversity. We carried out a metabarcoding study using universal 18S and COI markers to explore the composition of past and present eukaryotic communities of a Pyrenean peat bog ecosystem. We assessed the molecular biodiversity of four different moss micro-habitats along a flood gradient in the lentic Bassa Nera system (Central Pyrenees). Five samples collected from different sediment depths at the same study site were also analysed, to test the suitability of these universal markers for studying paleoecological communities recovered from ancient DNA and to compare the detected DNA sequences to those obtained from the modern community. We also compared the information provided by the sedimentary DNA to the reconstruction from environmental proxies such as pollen and macro-remains from the same record. We successfully amplified ancient DNA with both universal markers from all sediment samples, including the deepest one (\textasciitilde{} 10,000~years old). Most of the metabarcoding reads obtained from sediment samples, however, were assigned to living edaphic organisms and only a small fraction of those reads was considered to be derived from paleoecological communities. Inferences from ancient sedimentary DNA were complementary to the reconstruction based on pollen and macro-remains, and the combined records reveal more detailed information. This molecular study yielded promising findings regarding the diversity of modern eukaryotic peat bog communities. Nevertheless, even though information about past communities could be retrieved from sediment samples, preferential amplification of DNA from living communities is a caveat for the use of universal metabarcoding markers in paleoecology.},

Looking towards 2050, the question is how fisheries governance, and the national and international policy and legal frameworks within which it is nested, will ensure a sustainable harvest, maintain biodiversity and ecosystem functions, and adapt to climate change. This paper looks at global fisheries production, the state of resources, contribution to food security and governance.

Here we present one such approach, the “biological ensemble modeling approach,” using the Eastern Baltic cod (               Gadus morhua callarias               ) as an example. The core of the approach is to expose an ensemble of models with different ecological assumptions to climate forcing, using multiple realizations of each climate scenario. We simulated the long‐term response of cod to future fishing and climate change in seven ecological models ranging from single‐species to food web models. These models were analyzed using the “biological ensemble modeling approach” by which we (1) identified a key ecological mechanism explaining the differences in simulated cod responses between models, (2) disentangled the uncertainty caused by differences in ecological model assumptions from the statistical uncertainty of future climate, and (3) identified results common for the whole model ensemble. Species interactions greatly influenced the simulated response of cod to fishing and climate, as well as the degree to which the statistical uncertainty of climate trajectories carried through to uncertainty of cod responses. Models ignoring the feedback from prey on cod showed large interannual fluctuations in cod dynamics and were more sensitive to the underlying uncertainty of climate forcing than models accounting for such stabilizing predator–prey feedbacks. Yet in all models, intense fishing prevented recovery, and climate change further decreased the cod population. Our study demonstrates how the biological ensemble modeling approach makes it possible to evaluate the relative importance of different sources of uncertainty in future species responses, as well as to seek scientific conclusions and sustainable management solutions robust to uncertainty of food web processes in the face of climate change.},

Legislation also increasingly requires the attainment of good environmental status, which again demands collection of data to enable efficient monitoring and management of biodiversity. Such data is traditionally obtained as a result of research surveys through the capture and/or visual identification of organisms. Recent years have seen significant advances in the utilisation of environmental DNA (eDNA) in the marine environment in order to develop alternative cost-effective ways to gather relevant data. Such approaches attempt to identify and/or quantify the species present at a location through the detection of extra-organismal DNA in the environment. These new eDNA based approaches have the potential to revolutionise data collection in the marine environment using non-invasive sampling methods and providing snapshots of biodiversity beyond the capacity of traditional sampling. Here we present a non-technical summary of different approaches in the field of eDNA, and emphasise the broad application of this approach, with value for the governance and management of marine aquatic ecosystems. The review focuses on identifying those tools which are now readily applicable and those which show promise but are currently in development and require further validations. The aim is to provide an understanding of techniques and concepts that can be used by managers without genetic or genomic expertise when consulting with specialists to perform joint evaluations of the utility of the approaches},

Even though marked seasonal changes have been reported for whole microbial communities, less is known on the dynamics and seasonality of individual taxa. Here, we aim at understanding microbial recurrence at three different levels: community, taxonomic group and operational taxonomic units (OTUs). For that, we focused on a model microbial eukaryotic community populating a long-term marine microbial observatory using 18S rRNA gene data from two organismal size fractions: the picoplankton (0.2–3 µm) and the nanoplankton (3–20 µm). We have developed an index to quantify recurrence in particular taxa. We found that community structure oscillated systematically between two main configurations corresponding to winter and summer over the 10 years studied. A few taxonomic groups such as Mamiellophyceae or MALV-III presented clear recurrence (i.e., seasonality), whereas 13\%–19\% of the OTUs in both size fractions, accounting for \textasciitilde 40\% of the relative abundance, featured recurrent dynamics. Altogether, our work links long-term whole community dynamics with that of individual OTUs and taxonomic groups, indicating that recurrent and non-recurrent changes characterize the dynamics of microbial assemblages.},

Several policy documents and research articles have identified the need for MSP to address change, intended as dynamic aspects from different drivers. However, practical examples of MSP embracing change and dynamics are rare and the inclusion of system dynamics, environmental variability and future change in MSP remains challenging. Here, we conceptualize the multiple dimensions of change in MSP consisting in i) the dynamics of the marine and coastal social-ecological system (SES), and ii) the dynamics of the planning process. This study depicts the current state of scientific knowledge on incorporating change and dynamics in MSP through a systematic literature review. Efforts to actually incorporate change in MSP are mainly limited to environmental dynamics, while social and governance changes are rarely represented. Long-term temporal scales are only seldom considered, and climate change effects rarely incorporated in methods and tools to support MSP. We propose a tier-approach to include multiple response variables and scenario modeling to address socio-economic, environmental and governance change and dynamics within MSP.},

  abstract = {Monitoring of marine protected areas (MPAs) is critical for marine ecosystem management, yet current protocols rely on SCUBA-based visual surveys that are costly and time consuming, limiting their scope and effectiveness. Environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding is a promising alternative for marine ecosystem monitoring, but more direct comparisons to visual surveys are needed to understand the strengths and limitations of each approach. This study compares fish communities inside and outside the Scorpion State Marine Reserve off Santa Cruz Island, CA using eDNA metabarcoding and underwater visual census surveys. Results from eDNA captured 76\% (19/25) of fish species and 95\% (19/20) of fish genera observed during pairwise underwater visual census. Species missed by eDNA were due to the inability of MiFish 12S barcodes to differentiate species of rockfishes (Sebastes, n = 4) or low site occupancy rates of crevice-dwelling Lythrypnus gobies. However, eDNA detected an additional 23 fish species not recorded in paired visual surveys, but previously reported from prior visual surveys, highlighting the sensitivity of eDNA. Significant variation in eDNA signatures by location (50 m) and site (\textasciitilde 1000 m) demonstrates the sensitivity of eDNA to address key questions such as community composition inside and outside MPAs. Results demonstrate the utility of eDNA metabarcoding for monitoring marine ecosystems, providing an important complementary tool to visual methods.},

  abstract = {Metabarcoding is a powerful molecular tool for simultaneously surveying hundreds to thousands of species from a single sample, underpinning microbiome and environmental DNA (eDNA) methods. Deriving quantitative estimates of underlying biological communities from metabarcoding is critical for enhancing the utility of such approaches for health and conservation. Recent work has demonstrated that correcting for amplification biases in genetic metabarcoding data can yield quantitative estimates of template DNA concentrations. However, a major source of uncertainty in metabarcoding data stems from non-detections across technical PCR replicates where one replicate fails to detect a species observed in other replicates. Such non-detections are a special case of variability among technical replicates in metabarcoding data. While many sampling and amplification processes underlie observed variation in metabarcoding data, understanding the causes of non-detections is an important step in distinguishing signal from noise in metabarcoding studies. Here, we use both simulated and empirical data to 1) suggest how non-detections may arise in metabarcoding data, 2) outline steps to recognize uninformative data in practice, and 3) identify the conditions under which amplicon sequence data can reliably detect underlying biological signals. We show with both simulations and empirical data that, for a given species, the rate of non-detections among technical replicates is a function of both the template DNA concentration and species-specific amplification efficiency. Consequently, we conclude metabarcoding datasets are strongly affected by (1) deterministic amplification biases during PCR and (2) stochastic sampling of amplicons during sequencing—both of which we can model—but also by (3) stochastic sampling of rare molecules prior to PCR, which remains a frontier for quantitative metabarcoding. Our results highlight the importance of estimating species-specific amplification efficiencies and critically evaluating patterns of non-detection in metabarcoding datasets to better distinguish environmental signal from the noise inherent in molecular detections of rare targets.},

Detecting species using eDNA methods, rather than directly sampling the organisms, can reduce impacts on sensitive species and increase the power of field surveys for rare and elusive species. The sensitivity of eDNA methods, however, requires a heightened awareness and attention to quality assurance and quality control protocols. Additionally, the interpretation of eDNA data demands careful consideration of multiple factors. As eDNA methods have grown in application, diverse approaches have been implemented to address these issues. With interest in eDNA continuing to expand, supportive guidelines for undertaking eDNA studies are greatly needed. Environmental DNA researchers from around the world have collaborated to produce this set of guidelines and considerations for implementing eDNA methods to detect aquatic macroorganisms. Critical considerations for study design include preventing contamination in the field and the laboratory, choosing appropriate sample analysis methods, validating assays, testing for sample inhibition and following minimum reporting guidelines. Critical considerations for inference include temporal and spatial processes, limits of correlation of eDNA with abundance, uncertainty of positive and negative results, and potential sources of allochthonous DNA. We present a synthesis of knowledge at this stage for application of this new and powerful detection method.},

  abstract = {The detection of rare macroorganisms using environmental DNA (eDNA) is a powerful new method for conservation and management; the efficacy of this method is affected by physiological, ecological, and hydrological processes. Understanding the processes limiting eDNA detection and accounting for those factors with optimized sampling designs is critical for realizing the potential of this tool. Amphibians are a focus of conservation programs globally and are often difficult to detect, presenting a challenge for effective action. To increase the ability of eDNA techniques to inform conservation and management programs, we investigated the eDNA detection of amphibians compared with field surveys for six species across a gradient of environmental factors expected to affect eDNA detection in three different systems: perennial wetlands, intermittent wetlands, and acidic intermittent wetlands. We applied a baseline sampling design in each wetland and used an occupancy modeling approach to evaluate evidence for processes limiting detection for each species given the presence of the target species. Evidence weights indicated that limiting processes varied across systems and included those associated with increased degradation (pH {$<$} 5, temperature {$>$} 25 °C) and limited dispersion (wetland area {$>$} 1200 m2, sample volume {$<$} 200 mL). Optimized sampling protocols based on model results included an increased number of sampling locations in large and highly degradative (acidic) wetlands and increased filter pore size in high-particulate systems. These improved designs compensated for the previously limiting factors and yielded average detection rates of 0.62–0.86 per water sample. Degradation and dispersion processes appear to strongly influence the detection of amphibians in wetlands. Optimized, adaptive sampling designs can greatly increase the efficacy of eDNA monitoring approaches.},

This is a fast-moving field and one that is the focus of intense research interest. However the rapid development of new methods, the inconsistent and sometimes confusing application of old ones, and the lack of consensus in the literature about the best approach, means that there is a real need for a current synthesis. Biological Diversity covers fundamental measurement issues such as sampling, re-examines familiar diversity metrics (including species richness, diversity statistics, and estimates of spatial and temporal turnover), discusses species abundance distributions and how best to fit them, explores species occurrence and the spatial structure of biodiversity, and investigates alternative approaches used to assess trait, phylogenetic, and genetic diversity. The final section of the book turns to a selection of contemporary challenges such as measuring microbial diversity, evaluating the impact of disturbance, assessing biodiversity in managed landscapes, measuring diversity in the imperfect fossil record, and using species density estimates in management and conservation.},

It builds upon theoretical strands from the resource-based and entrepreneurship perspectives. Research within these fields indicates that these relationships might be dependent on the context within which the firm operates. Hypotheses are developed to test the possible effect of entrepreneurial efforts and resources (financial position, farm size, location, network and unique competence) on short- and longterm performance. Data gathered in 2003 and 2006 from farms engaged in innovative ventures were used to test the hypotheses. The results show that financial capacity, unique competence and entrepreneurial efforts influence performance in the investigated firms. This suggests that firms do get paid back in the long run for engaging in entrepreneurial efforts. Thus, entrepreneurial activities and attitudes represent an important factor enabling firms to create, reconsider and apply their resources in more efficient ways. © 2011 Taylor \& Francis.},

While globally the pandemic is at different stages and far from under control in some countries, now is the time for public health researchers and political scientists to start understanding how and why governments responded the way they have, explore how effective these responses appear to be, and what lessons we can draw about effective public health policymaking in preparation of the next wave of COVID-19 or the next infectious disease pandemic. We argue that there will be no way to understand the different responses to COVID-19 and their effects without understanding policy and politics. We propose four key focuses to understand the reasons for COVID-19 responses: social policies to crisis management as well as recovery, regime type (democracy or autocracy), formal political institutions (federalism, presidentialism), and state capacity (control over health care systems and public administration). A research agenda to address the COVID-19 pandemic that takes politics as a serious focus can enable the development of more realistic, sustainable interventions in policies and shape our broader understanding of the politics of public health.},

However, sampling effort must be considered when interpreting results from these surveys. We explored how sampling effort influenced biodiversity patterns and nonindigenous species (NIS) detection in an eDNA metabarcoding survey of four commercial ports. Overall, we captured sequences from 18 metazoan phyla with minimal differences in taxonomic coverage between 18 S and COI primer sets. While community dissimilarity patterns were consistent across primers and sampling effort, richness patterns were not, suggesting that richness estimates are extremely sensitive to primer choice and sampling effort. The survey detected 64 potential NIS, with COI identifying more known NIS from port checklists but 18 S identifying more operational taxonomic units shared between three or more ports that represent un-recorded potential NIS. Overall, we conclude that eDNA metabarcoding surveys can reveal global similarity patterns among ports across a broad array of taxa and can also detect potential NIS in these key habitats. However, richness estimates and species assignments require caution. Based on results of this study, we make several recommendations for port eDNA sampling design and suggest several areas for future research.},

We characterized α and β-diversity of deep-sea assemblages from submarine canyons in the western Mediterranean using an environmental DNA metabarcoding. We used a new primer set targeting a short eukaryotic 18S sequence (ca. 110 bp). We applied a protocol designed to obtain extractions enriched in extracellular DNA from replicated sediment corers. With this strategy we captured information from DNA (local or deposited from the water column) that persists adsorbed to inorganic particles and buffered short-term spatial and temporal heterogeneity. We analysed replicated samples from 20 localities including 2 deep-sea canyons, 1 shallower canal, and two open slopes (depth range 100-2,250 m). We identified 1,629 MOTUs, among which the dominant groups were Metazoa (with representatives of 19 phyla), Alveolata, Stramenopiles, and Rhizaria. There was a marked small-scale heterogeneity as shown by differences in replicates within corers and within localities. The spatial variability between canyons was significant, as was the depth component in one of the canyons where it was tested. Likewise, the composition of the first layer (1 cm) of sediment was significantly different from deeper layers. We found that qualitative (presence-absence) and quantitative (relative number of reads) data showed consistent trends of differentiation between samples and geographic areas. The subset of exclusively benthic MOTUs showed similar patterns of β-diversity and community structure as the whole dataset. Separate analyses of the main metazoan phyla (in number of MOTUs) showed some differences in distribution attributable to different lifestyles. Our results highlight the differentiation that can be found even between geographically close assemblages, and sets the ground for future monitoring and conservation efforts on these bottoms of ecological and economic importance.},

A Stock table, and a table of “Catches of data-poor species” constitute a comprehensive system for monitoring the management principle. Along with a Fisheries table, these tables establish a framework for developing an ecosystem-based fisheries management by providing a basis and tools for prioritising the needs of new and/or revised management measures.},

Our study uses a multigene approach, including the mitochondrial cytochrome-c-oxidase subunit I (COI) gene for analyzing species composition and the nuclear hypervariable region V8 of 18S rDNA for analyzing supraspecific biodiversity. A new minibarcode primer (124 bp) was created on the basis of a metazoan COI barcode library with 506 species and tested in silico, in vitro, and in situ. We applied high throughput sequencing to filtrates of 23 near-bottom water samples taken at three seasons from 14 stations. The set of COI primers allowed amplification of mitochondrial minibarcodes for diverse metazoan phyla and the differentiation at the species level for more than 99\% of the specimens in the dataset. Our results revealed that the number of sequences is not consistent with proportions in the given DNA mixture. Altogether, environmental sequences could be assigned to 114 species and to 12 metazoan phyla. A spatial distribution of taxa recovered by eDNA was congruent with known distributions. Finally, the successful detection of species and biodiversity depends on a comprehensive sequence reference database. Our study offers a powerful tool for future biodiversity research, including the detection of nonnative species.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT             Environmental DNA (eDNA) detection employing quantitative PCR (qPCR) and droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) offers a non‐invasive and efficient approach for monitoring aquatic organisms. Accurate and sensitive quantification of eDNA is crucial for tracking rare and invasive species and understanding the biodiversity abundance and distribution of aquatic organisms. This study compares the sensitivity and quantification precision of qPCR and ddPCR for eDNA surveys through Bayesian inference using latent parameters from both known concentration (standards) and environmental samples across three teleost fish species assays. The results show that ddPCR offers higher sensitivity and quantification precision, particularly at low DNA concentrations ({$<$}\,1 copy/μL reaction), than qPCR. These findings highlight the superior performance of ddPCR for eDNA detection at low concentrations, guiding researchers towards more reliable methods for effective species monitoring. Additionally, this study indicates that a two‐step (detection and concentration) model increased the precision of qPCR results, useful for enhancing the robustness of eDNA quantification. Furthermore, we investigated the lower limit of quantification for ddPCR, providing insights on how such limit can be extended, which could also be applied to qPCR.},

  abstract = {Quantifying the biomass, or number of individuals, diversity, and distribution of marine species is a critical aspect of understanding and managing marine ecosystems. In recent years, there has been growing interest in using environmental DNA (eDNA) for marine ecosystem management and biodiversity assessment. However, the main challenge hindering eDNA applicability has been the inability to infer absolute species abundances from multispecies analysis (eDNA metabarcoding). In this study, we demonstrate a way forward by estimating the abundance of commercially important fish species in a Norwegian fjord using a joint Bayesian statistical model of traditional trawl-catch data and molecular data derived from eDNA. Using this model, we accurately predict out-of-sample trawl catches using eDNA alone. Moreover, our model provides empirical estimates for key processes linking marine eDNA concentration to the fish population abundance estimated from trawl observations, including trawl catchability, DNA shedding, degradation, dilution, transport, recovery rate, and isolation efficiency. These processes, including amplification efficiencies correcting for Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) bias, are species-specific and enable the translation of eDNA metabarcoding data into abundances. These findings have broad implications for the use of eDNA in marine ecosystem management and conservation efforts.},

Thus, correctly modeling and quantifying human mobility is critical for studying large-scale spatial transmission of infectious diseases and improving epidemic control. In this study, a large-scale agent-based transport simulation (MATSim) is linked with a generic epidemic spread model to simulate the spread of communicable diseases in an urban environment. The use of an agent-based model allows reproduction of the real-world behavior of individuals’ daily path in an urban setting and allows the capture of interactions among them, in the form of a spatial-temporal social network. This model is used to study seasonal influenza outbreaks in the metropolitan area of Zurich, Switzerland. The observations of the agent-based models are compared with results from classical SIR models. The model presented is a prototype that can be used to analyze multiple scenarios in the case of a disease spread at an urban scale, considering variations of different model parameters settings. The results of this simulation can help to improve comprehension of the disease spread dynamics and to take better steps towards the prevention and control of an epidemic.},

We examined factors influencing presence of indicators using 52 video monitoring reports collected in Newfoundland, Canada. The main driving factor was distance to cage, with indicators showing a higher probability of occurrence within 10 m from cages due to low current velocities. Indicators were less prevalent on sites dominated by hard substrates while OPC in particular were restricted to depths {$>$}. 35 m. Beggiatoa-like bacteria covered a larger surface than the two other indicators; however, our results suggest the necessity of amalgamating information related to all the indicators (including bare stations that could indicate anoxia) to establish a more accurate evaluation of aquaculture impact.},

The apparent simplicity and cost-effectiveness of eDNA analysis make it highly attractive as species distributions can be revealed from water samples. Further, species-specific analyses indicate that eDNA concentrations correlate with biomass and abundance, suggesting the possibility for quantitative applications estimating abundance and biomass of specific organisms in marine ecosystems, such as for stock assessment. However, the path from detecting occurrence of an organism to quantitative estimates is long and indirect, not least as eDNA concentration depends on several physical, chemical and biological factors which influence its production, persistence and transport in marine ecosystems. Here, we provide an overview of basic principles in relation to eDNA analysis with potential for marine fisheries application. We describe fundamental processes governing eDNA generation, breakdown and transport and summarize current uncertainties about these processes. We describe five major challenges in relation to application in fisheries assessment, where there is immediate need for knowledge building in marine systems, and point to apparent weaknesses of eDNA compared to established marine fisheries monitoring methods. We provide an overview of emerging applications of interest to fisheries management and point to recent technological advances, which could improve analysis efficiency. We advise precaution against exaggerating the present scope for application of eDNA analysis in fisheries monitoring, but also argue that with informed insights into strengths and limitations, eDNA analysis can become an integrated tool in fisheries assessment and management.},

In order to overcome these challenges a robotic sampler, a 2nd generation Environmental Sample Processor (ESP), was tested for autonomous analysis of eDNA from four commercial fish species in a 4.5 million liter mesocosm. The ESP enabled in situ analysis, consisting of water collection, filtration, DNA extraction and qPCR analysis, which allowed for real-time remote reporting and archival sample collection, consisting of water collection, filtration and chemical preservation followed by post-deployment laboratory analysis. The results demonstrate that the 2G ESP was able to consistently detect and quantify target molecules from the most abundant species (Atlantic mackerel) both in real-time and from the archived samples. In contrast, detection of low abundant species was challenged by both biological and technical aspects coupled to the ecology of eDNA and the 2G ESP instrumentation. Comparison of the in situ analysis and archival samples demonstrated variance, which potentially was linked to diel migration patterns of the Atlantic mackerel. The study demonstrates strong potential for remote autonomous in situ monitoring which open new possibilities for the field of eDNA and marine monitoring.},

In this review, we discuss the role that differing environments play on the major processes that eDNA undergoes between organism and collection, including shedding, decay and transport. We focus on a mechanistic understanding of these processes and highlight how decay and transport models are being developed towards more accurate and robust predictions of the fate of eDNA.

The city is celebrating its thriving neo-liberal urbanism by implementing enormous new-build gentrification, mostly in the form of demolition-rebuild development involving direct displacement of residents and landscapes. This study aims to understand demographic changes and the socioeconomic consequences of new-build gentrification in central Shanghai. The paper first examines demographic changes between 1990 and 2000 in central Shanghai, i.e. the changing distribution of potential gentrifiers and displacees. It then looks into two cases of new-build gentrification projects in central Shanghai, to compare residents' socioeconomic profiles in old neighbourhoods and new-build areas. This study also examines the impacts of gentrification on displacees' quality of life and socioeconomic prospects. Because the enlarging middle class and the pursuit of wealth-induced growth by the municipal government are turning the central city into a hotspot of gentrification, inequalities in housing and socioeconomic prospects are being produced and intensified in the metropolitan area. This study thus emphasises that critical perspectives in gentrification research are valuable and indispensable. © 2009 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

We tested these assumptions in a fully mapped 50-ha subtropical evergreen forest of China, where we assessed the degrees of interspecies spatial associations between adult trees and between saplings at two different spatial scales (10 m versus 40 m) and measured the degrees of trait dissimilarity of the associated species using six traits (leaf area, specific leaf area, leaf dry-matter content, wood density, wood dry-matter content and maximum height). Consistent across spatial scales and plant life stages, the degree of interspecies spatial association and the degree of overall trait dissimilarity (i.e. all six traits together) were negatively correlated, suggesting that environmental filtering might help assemble functionally similar species in the forest under study. However, when we looked into the spatial association–trait dissimilarity relationship for individual traits, we found that the relationships between interspecies spatial associations and the dissimilarity of wood density and dry-matter content were significant for adults but not for saplings, suggesting the importance of wood traits in species’ survival during ontogeny. We conclude that processes shaping interspecies spatial association are spatial scale and plant life stage dependent, and that the distributions of functional traits offer useful insights into the processes underlying community spatial structure.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Marine Protected Areas require comprehensive monitoring to ensure objectives are achieved; however, monitoring natural ecosystems at scale is challenged by the biodiversity it aims to measure. Environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding holds promise to address this monitoring challenge. We conducted paired sampling at 54 sites for fish and invertebrate assemblages in the Northwest Atlantic using groundfish trawls and eDNA metabarcoding of benthic seawater using four genetic markers (12S rRNA, 16S rRNA, 18S rRNA, and CO1). Compared to trawling, eDNA detected similar patterns of species turnover, larger estimates of gamma diversity, and smaller estimates of alpha diversity. A total of 63.6\% (42/66) of fish species captured by trawling were detected by eDNA, along with an additional 26 species. Of the 24 missed detections by eDNA, 12 were inevitable as they lacked reference sequences. Excluding taxa assigned to higher than species level and those without a species name, 23.6\% (17/72) of invertebrate species captured by trawling were detected by CO1, which detected an additional 98 species. We demonstrate that eDNA is capable of detecting patterns of community assemblage and species turnover in an offshore environment, emphasizing its strong potential for a non-invasive, comprehensive, and scalable tool for biodiversity monitoring supporting marine conservation programmes.},

  abstract = {Subsampling is a commonly used method for estimating the composition of trawl catches. In many fisheries, an increasing number of trawlers use recirculating seawater hoppers to hold catches before extraction by a sorting conveyor belt from which the target species and byproduct are sorted from the bycatch. We tested whether taking subsamples from the sorting conveyor belt at different times during catch-sorting, biased estimates of bycatch composition in Australia's Northern Prawn Fishery. We divided the entire bycatch from three trawls into subsamples (about 10 kg each) numbered chronologically as they were taken from the sorting conveyor belt. Within each catch, we grouped the subsamples into three catch groups: the first, the middle and the last third of the catch (as they were extracted from the seawater hopper). We compared the catch composition estimates from these three catch groups, separately for each catch. There were significant differences between the mean number of species recorded in each of the three catch groups. Mean numbers of individuals (within species) were also unevenly distributed when compared across the three catch groups, for more than 29\% of 'rare' species, 61\% of 'common' and 75\% of 'abundant' species. Between 45 and 56\% of these unevenly distributed species had significantly higher relative abundances in the first catch group extracted by the sorting conveyor belt. A further 10-16\% of species had significantly higher relative abundances in the middle catch group, and between 31 and 39\% had significantly higher relative abundances in the last catch group. Because the catches were immersed in the seawater hoppers, the distribution of species on the sorting conveyor belt was probably affected by the buoyancy of individual species, changing seawater levels and the size of catch. To overcome this bias, we recommend taking bycatch samples from a small temporary tray placed over the seawater hopper before the codends are spilled. © 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

  abstract = {The origins of the Indo-European language family are hotly disputed.~Bayesian phylogenetic analyses of core~vocabulary have~produced~conflicting results,~with some supporting a farming~expansion out of Anatolia \textasciitilde 9000~years before present (yr B.P.),~while others support a spread with~horse-based pastoralism out of the Pontic-Caspian Steppe \textasciitilde 6000~yr B.P.~Here we present an extensive database of Indo-European core vocabulary that eliminates past inconsistencies in cognate coding. Ancestry-enabled phylogenetic analysis of this dataset indicates that few ancient languages are direct ancestors of modern clades and produces a root age of \textasciitilde 8120 yr B.P. for the family. Although this date is not consistent with the Steppe hypothesis, it does not rule out an initial homeland south of the Caucasus, with a subsequent branch northward onto the steppe and then across Europe. We reconcile this hybrid hypothesis with recently published ancient~DNA~evidence from the steppe and the northern Fertile Crescent.~           ,              Editor’s summary                            Languages of the Indo-European family are spoken by almost half of the world’s population, but their origins and patterns of spread are disputed. Heggarty               et al               . present a database of 109 modern and 52 time-calibrated historical Indo-European languages, which they analyzed with models of Bayesian phylogenetic inference. Their results suggest an emergence of Indo-European languages around 8000 years before present. This is a deeper root date than previously thought, and it fits with an initial origin south of the Caucasus followed by a branch northward into the Steppe region. These findings lead to a “hybrid hypothesis” that reconciles current linguistic and ancient DNA evidence from both the eastern Fertile Crescent (as a primary source) and the steppe (as a secondary homeland). —SNV                        ,              Indo-European languages emerged south of the Caucasus around 8300 years ago, followed by an expansion northward to the Steppe regions.           ,                             INTRODUCTION               Almost half the world’s population speaks a language of the Indo-European language family. It remains unclear, however, where this family’s common ancestral language (Proto-Indo-European) was initially spoken and when and why it spread through Eurasia. The “Steppe” hypothesis posits an expansion out of the Pontic-Caspian Steppe, no earlier than 6500 years before present (yr B.P.), and mostly with horse-based pastoralism from \textasciitilde 5000 yr B.P. An alternative “Anatolian” or “farming” hypothesis posits that Indo-European dispersed with agriculture out of parts of the Fertile Crescent, beginning as early as \textasciitilde 9500 to 8500 yr B.P. Ancient DNA (aDNA) is now bringing valuable new perspectives, but these remain only indirect interpretations of language prehistory. In this study, we tested between the time-depth predictions of the Anatolian and Steppe hypotheses, directly from language data. We report a new framework for the chronology and divergence sequence of Indo-European, using Bayesian phylogenetic methods applied to an extensive new dataset of core vocabulary across 161 Indo-European languages.                                         RATIONALE               Previous phylolinguistic analyses have produced conflicting results. We diagnosed and resolved the causes of this discrepancy, two in particular. First, the datasets used had limited language sampling and widespread coding inconsistency. Second, some analyses enforced the assumption that modern spoken languages derive directly from ancient written languages rather than from parallel spoken varieties. Together, these methodological problems distorted branch-length estimates and date inferences. We present a new dataset of cognacy (shared word origins) across Indo-European. This dataset eliminates past inconsistencies and provides a fuller and more balanced language sample, including 52 nonmodern languages for a denser set of time-calibration points. We applied ancestry-enabled Bayesian phylogenetic analysis to test rather than enforce direct ancestry assumptions.                                         RESULTS               Few ancient written languages are returned as direct ancestors of modern clades. We find a median root age for Indo-European of \textasciitilde 8120 yr B.P. (95\% highest posterior density: 6740 to 9610 yr B.P.). Our chronology is robust across a range of alternative phylogenetic models and sensitivity analyses that vary data subsets and other parameters. Indo-European had already diverged rapidly into multiple major branches by \textasciitilde 7000 yr B.P., without a coherent non-Anatolian core. Indo-Iranic has no close relationship with Balto-Slavic, weakening the case for it having spread via the steppe.                                         CONCLUSION               Our results are not entirely consistent with either the Steppe hypothesis or the farming hypothesis. Recent aDNA evidence suggests that the Anatolian branch cannot be sourced to the steppe but rather to south of the Caucasus. For other branches, potential candidate expansion(s) out of the Yamnaya culture are detectable in aDNA, but some had only limited genetic impact. Our results reveal that these expansions from \textasciitilde 5000 yr B.P. onward also came too late for the language chronology of Indo-European divergence. They are consistent, however, with an ultimate homeland south of the Caucasus and a subsequent branch northward onto the steppe, as a secondary homeland for some branches of Indo-European entering Europe with the later Corded Ware–associated expansions. Language phylogenetics and aDNA thus combine to suggest that the resolution to the 200-year-old Indo-European enigma lies in a hybrid of the farming and Steppe hypotheses.

A sampled approach to the Red List Index (RLI) was proposed, as many groups are highly speciose. However, a decade after its conception, the recommended 900 species sample has only been implemented in six groups and trend data are available for none, potentially because this sample is unfeasibly high. Using a broader set of all available data we show that when re-assessments are conducted every 10 years, 200 species (400 in some cases) should be sufficient to detect a RLI trend. Correctly detecting changes in slope still requires samples of 900 species (11,000 in some cases). Sampled assessments can accelerate biodiversity monitoring and complement current metrics, but the time-period between assessments and the approaches’ purpose should be carefully considered, as there is a trade-off between sample size and the resulting indices.},

  abstract = {Population viability analysis (PVA) has become a basic tool of current conservation practice. However, if not accounted for properly, the uncertainties inherent to PVA predictions can decrease the reliability of this type of analysis. In the present study, we performed a PVA of the whole western European population (France, Portugal, and Spain) of the endangered Bonelli's Eagle (               Aquila fasciata               ), in which we thoroughly explored the consequences of uncertainty in population processes and parameters on PVA predictions. First, we estimated key vital rates (survival, fertility, recruitment, and dispersal rates) using monitoring, ringing, and bibliographic data from the period 1990–2009 from 12 populations found throughout the studied geographic range. Second, we evaluated the uncertainty about model structure (i.e., the assumed processes that govern individual fates and population dynamics) by comparing the observed growth rates of the studied populations with model predictions for the same period. Third, using the model structures suggested in the previous step, we assessed the viability of both the local populations and the overall population. Finally, we analyzed the effects of model and parameter uncertainty on PVA predictions. Our results strongly support the idea that all local populations in western Europe belong to a single, spatially structured population operating as a source–sink system, whereby the populations in the south of the Iberian Peninsula act as sources and, thanks to dispersal, sustain all other local populations, which would otherwise decline. Predictions regarding population dynamics varied considerably, and models assuming more constrained dispersal predicted more pessimistic population trends than models assuming greater dispersal. Model predictions accounting for parameter uncertainty revealed a marked increase in the risk of population declines over the next 50 years. Sensitivity analyses indicated that adult and pre‐adult survival are the chief vital rates regulating these populations, and thus, the conservation efforts aimed at improving these survival rates should be strengthened in order to guarantee the long‐term viability of the European populations of this endangered species. Overall, the study provides a framework for the implementation of multi‐site PVAs and highlights the importance of dispersal processes in shaping the population dynamics of long‐lived birds distributed across heterogeneous landscapes.},

We combined targeted droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) quantification of two commercially important species, Atlantic mackerel (               Scombrus scombrus               ) and Atlantic herring (               Clupea harengus               ), with metabarcoding of fish and plankton communities. The goal of this study was to assess the performance of eDNA data to characterize pelagic communities and its use for environmental monitoring. The metabarcoding recovered 26 fish species including both pelagic and demersal taxa. The plankton data were dominated by dinoflagellates (               Karenia               ) and calanoid copepods. We found that both specific quantification of eDNA from mackerel and herring and eDNA metabarcoding of fish communities were able to reveal spatial patterns: Mackerel was most abundant in the surface across both OWF and reference sites; herring was present at a wider depth range. While ddPCR and metabarcoding data for these two species were broadly congruent, we observed detection/non‐detection mismatches for both methods, highlighting the need for robust sampling design. There was no consistent OWF versus reference area pattern in the demersal fraction of fish assemblages. We interpret our findings as representing a snapshot of fish school location around the time of sampling, and do not consider the single timepoint data from this pilot study to be sufficient to attribute any effects to the OWF itself. As a non‐invasive tool, we conclude that eDNA has a high potential in future environmental monitoring of OWFs. We recommend further ground‐truthing and biomass correlation of eDNA data with catch data and establishing eDNA time series as next steps towards implementation of eDNA in OWF environmental monitoring.},

  abstract = {River Influences on Shelf Ecosystems (RISE) is the first comprehensive interdisciplinary study of the rates and dynamics governing the mixing of river and coastal waters in an eastern boundary current system, as well as the effects of the resultant plume on phytoplankton standing stocks, growth and grazing rates, and community structure. The RISE Special Volume presents results deduced from four field studies and two different numerical model applications, including an ecosystem model, on the buoyant plume originating from the Columbia River. This introductory paper provides background information on variability during RISE field efforts as well as a synthesis of results, with particular attention to the questions and hypotheses that motivated this research. RISE studies have shown that the maximum mixing of Columbia River and ocean water occurs primarily near plume liftoff inside the estuary and in the near field of the plume. Most plume nitrate originates from upwelled shelf water, and plume phytoplankton species are typically the same as those found in the adjacent coastal ocean. River‐supplied nitrate can help maintain the ecosystem during periods of delayed upwelling. The plume inhibits iron limitation, but nitrate limitation is observed in aging plumes. The plume also has significant effects on rates of primary productivity and growth (higher in new plume water) and microzooplankton grazing (lower in the plume near field and north of the river mouth); macrozooplankton concentration (enhanced at plume fronts); offshelf chlorophyll export; as well as the development of a chlorophyll “shadow zone” off northern Oregon.},

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-α-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 Å for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21\% with default Glide SP settings to 58\% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63\% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40\% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

  abstract = {As the number of marine protected areas (MPAs) increases globally, so does the need to assess if MPAs are meeting their management goals. Integral to this assessment is usually a long-term biological monitoring program, which can be difficult to develop for large and remote areas that have little available fine-scale habitat and biological data. This is the situation for many MPAs within the newly declared Australian Commonwealth Marine Reserve (CMR) network which covers approximately 3.1 million km2 of continental shelf, slope, and abyssal habitat, much of which is remote and difficult to access. A detailed inventory of the species, types of assemblages present and their spatial distribution within individual MPAs is required prior to developing monitoring programs to measure the impact of management strategies. Here we use a spatially-balanced survey design and non-extractive baited video observations to quantitatively document the fish assemblages within the continental shelf area (a multiple use zone, IUCN VI) of the Flinders Marine Reserve, within the Southeast marine region. We identified distinct demersal fish assemblages, quantified assemblage relationships with environmental gradients (primarily depth and habitat type), and described their spatial distribution across a variety of reef and sediment habitats. Baited videos recorded a range of species from multiple trophic levels, including species of commercial and recreational interest. The majority of species, whilst found commonly along the southern or south-eastern coasts of Australia, are endemic to Australia, highlighting the global significance of this region. Species richness was greater on habitats containing some reef and declined with increasing depth. The trophic breath of species in assemblages was also greater in shallow waters. We discuss the utility of our approach for establishing inventories when little prior knowledge is available and how such an approach may inform future monitoring efforts within the CMR network.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT                            The grey wolf (                                C                 anis lupus                              ) is an iconic large carnivore that has increasingly been recognized as an apex predator with intrinsic value and a keystone species. However, wolves have also long represented a primary source of human–carnivore conflict, which has led to long‐term persecution of wolves, resulting in a significant decrease in their numbers, genetic diversity and gene flow between populations. For more effective protection and management of wolf populations in               E               urope, robust scientific evidence is crucial. This review serves as an analytical summary of the main findings from wolf population genetic studies in               E               urope, covering major studies from the ‘pre‐genomic era’ and the first insights of the ‘genomics era’. We analyse, summarize and discuss findings derived from analyses of three compartments of the mammalian genome with different inheritance modes: maternal (mitochondrial               DNA               ), paternal (               Y               chromosome) and biparental [autosomal microsatellites and single nucleotide polymorphisms (               SNPs               )]. To describe large‐scale trends and patterns of genetic variation in               E               uropean wolf populations, we conducted a meta‐analysis based on the results of previous microsatellite studies and also included new data, covering all 19               E               uropean countries for which wolf genetic information is available:               N               orway,               S               weden,               F               inland,               E               stonia,               L               atvia,               L               ithuania,               P               oland,               C               zech               R               epublic,               S               lovakia,               G               ermany,               B               elarus,               R               ussia,               I               taly,               C               roatia,               B               ulgaria,               B               osnia and               H               erzegovina,               G               reece,               S               pain and               P               ortugal. We compared different indices of genetic diversity in wolf populations and found a significant spatial trend in heterozygosity across               E               urope from south‐west (lowest genetic diversity) to north‐east (highest). The range of spatial autocorrelation calculated on the basis of three characteristics of genetic diversity was 650−850\,km, suggesting that the genetic diversity of a given wolf population can be influenced by populations up to 850\,km away. As an important outcome of this synthesis, we discuss the most pressing issues threatening wolf populations in               E               urope, highlight important gaps in current knowledge, suggest solutions to overcome these limitations, and provide recommendations for science‐based wolf conservation and management at regional and               E               urope‐wide scales.},

Although eDNA can provide critical information on the distribution and biomass of particular taxa, the DNA sequences of an organism remain unaltered throughout its existence, which complicates the accurate identification of crucial events, including spawning. Therefore, we examined DNA methylation as a novel source of information from eDNA, considering that the methylation patterns in eggs and sperm released during spawning differ from those of somatic tissues. Despite its potential applications, little is known about eDNA methylation, including its stability and methods for detection and quantification. Therefore, we conducted tank experiments and performed methylation analysis targeting 18S rDNA through bisulphite amplicon sequencing. In the target region, eDNA methylation was not affected by degradation and was equivalent to the methylation rate of genomic DNA from somatic tissues. Unmethylated DNA, abundant in the ovaries, was detected in the eDNA released during fish spawning. These results indicate that eDNA methylation is a stable signal reflecting targeted gene methylation and further demonstrate that germ cell‐specific methylation patterns can be used as markers for detecting fish spawning.},

While it is now widely acknowledged that anything local is complex, unstable, and relational, scholars continue to make truth claims about local actors and practices. This leads to an incomplete account of peacebuilding, as it conceals the powerful effects of representation, which shape our perspective on the local. We argue that the local is both used and produced through practices of representation, and that these representations serve to define what good peacebuilding entails. We consequently suggest a perspective on perspectives, which focuses on how representations of the local relate to political agendas in peacebuilding, and which can account for the effects of choosing one mode of representation over another. Through case studies from Burundi and South Sudan, we show that representations of the local are conflictingly produced by scholars, practitioners, and government officials, telling about the true, the good, and the bad local, empowering some and disempowering other actors, institutions, and practices. These dynamics have tangible effects on peace, conflict, and (in)security.},

  abstract = {Environmental DNA (eDNA) surveys are increasingly being used for biodiversity monitoring, principally because they are sensitive and can provide high resolution community composition data. Despite considerable progress in recent years, eDNA studies examining how different environmental sample types can affect species detectability remain rare. Comparisons of environmental samples are especially important for providing best practice guidance on early detection and subsequent mitigation of non-indigenous species. Here we used eDNA metabarcoding of COI (cytochrome c oxidase subunit I) and 18S (nuclear small subunit ribosomal DNA) genes to compare community composition between sediment and water samples in artificial coastal sites across the United Kingdom. We first detected markedly different communities and a consistently greater number of distinct operational taxonomic units in sediment compared to water. We then compared our eDNA datasets with previously published rapid assessment biodiversity surveys and found excellent concordance among the different survey techniques. Finally, our eDNA surveys detected many non-indigenous species, including several newly introduced species, highlighting the utility of eDNA metabarcoding for both early detection and temporal / spatial monitoring of non-indigenous species. We conclude that careful consideration on environmental sample type is needed when conducting eDNA surveys, especially for studies assessing community change.},

  abstract = {The detection of species using environmental DNA (eDNA) relies on our capacity to identify DNA from the sampled environment. Once eDNA is released into the environment, the physical degradation of individual eDNA molecules over time directly affects our ability to detect species (eDNA decay). Therefore, interpreting eDNA data requires an explicit understanding of eDNA decay to accurately infer contemporary presence or absence of a given species in the study ecosystem. Most research to date on eDNA decay has focused on single-species assays (predominantly quantitative PCR), and thus little is known on how eDNA decay affects the interpretation of metabarcoding datasets. Here, we used eDNA metabarcoding (targeting a section of the eukaryotic cytochrome c oxidase subunit I gene) of water samples from controlled tanks to examine eDNA decay in a wide variety of marine metazoan species. After the stocked organisms were removed from these tanks, we observed a sharp decrease in amplicon sequence variant (ASV) richness within the first 48 hours. Furthermore, there was a substantial change in beta diversity between 24 and 48 hours, and after 48 hours, most stocked species became undetectable. Interestingly, the estimated decay rate for each study species, calculated using a linear regression of reads over time, differed across organisms, with up to 2–3-fold difference among species. Our results showed that, for marine temperate species, the most substantial change in eDNA metabarcoding detectability occurred within the first 48 h, and after that, eDNA from several taxa became undetectable. These findings inform the ecological interpretation of metabarcoding datasets and provide estimates of eDNA decay rate that are valuable for both simulation studies and the design of future ecological surveys.},

Through this article, the authors contribute to the discussion by exploring both the extent to which gender approaches have been relevant to the human security debate thus far and how they can offer some directions forward. They argue that gender approaches deliver more credence and substance to a wider security concept, but also enable a theoretical conceptualization more reflective of security concerns that emanate from the 'bottom up'. The authors therefore incorporate gender theory to develop human security as an epistemological perspective to security studies. Gender theory claims that security must be linked to empowerment of the individual, as well as to the capabilities to create positive environments of security. They employ the tool of resistance as one crucial example of human agency in security. Practices of resistance, in the latter's various empirical forms, are present in all social contexts. Such a perspective on security directs attention to the practices of agents and provides a basis for exploring contextually dependent insecurities and securities. © 2006 PRIO.},

An increase in freshwater discharge from Greenland has the potential to strongly influence the composition of adjacent water masses with the largest impact on marine ecosystems likely to be found within the glaciated fjords. Here we demonstrate that physical and chemical estuarine processes within a large Greenlandic fjord are critical factors in determining the fate of meltwater derived nutrients and particles, especially for non-conservative elements such as Fe. Concentrations of Fe and macronutrients in surface waters along Godthåbsfjord, a southwest Greenlandic fjord with freshwater input fromsix glaciers, changedmarkedly between the onset andpeak of the meltwater season due to the development of a thin ({$<$}10 m), outflowing, low-salinity surface layer. Dissolved ({$<$}0.2 µm) Fe concentrations in meltwater entering Godthåbsfjord (200nM), in freshly melted glacial ice (mean 38nM) and in surface waters close to a land terminating glacial system (80nM) all indicated high Fe inputs into the fjord in summer. Total dissolvable (unfiltered at pH {$<$}2.0) Fe was similarly high with concentrations always in excess of 100nM throughout the fjord and reaching up to 5.0µM close to glacial outflows in summer. Yet, despite the large seasonal freshwater influx into the fjord, Fe concentrations near the fjord mouth in the out-flowing surface layer were similar in summer to those measured before the meltwater season. Furthermore, turbidity profiles indicated that sub-glacial particulate Fe inputs may not actually mix into the outflowing surface layer of this fjord. Emphasis has previously been placed on the possibility of increased Fe export from Greenland as meltwater fluxes increase. Here we suggest that in-fjord processes may be effective at removing Fe fromsurface waters before it can be exported to coastal seas.},

  abstract = {The developed world has invested billions of dollars in waste treatment since the 1970s; however, changes in ecological or biological responses are rarely associated with reductions in metal pollutants. Here we present a novel, 23-yr time series of environmental change from a San Francisco Bay mudflat located 1 km from the discharge of a suburban domestic sewage treatment plant. Samples of surface sediment, the bioindicator Macoma balthica, and metals loading data were used to establish links between discharge, bioaccumulation, and effects. Mean annual Ag concentrations in M. balthica were 106 μg/g in 1978 and 3.67 μg/g in 1998. Concentrations of Cu declined from 287 μg/g in 1980 to a minimum of 24 μg/g in 1991. Declining Cu bioaccumulation was strongly correlated with decreasing Cu loads from the plant between 1977 and 1998. Relationships with bioaccumulation and total annual precipitation suggested that inputs from nonpoint sources were most important in controlling Zn bioavailability during the same period. Ecoepidemiological criteria were used to associate failed gamete production in M. balthica to a metals-enriched environment. Reproduction persistently failed between the mid-1970s and mid-1980s; it recovered after metal contamination declined. Other potential environmental causes such as food availability, sediment chemistry, or seasonal salinity fluctuations were not related to the timing of the change in reproductive capability. The results establish an associative link, suggesting that it is important to further investigate the chemical interference of Cu and/or Ag with invertebrate reproduction at relatively moderate levels of environmental contamination.},

  abstract = {This paper reviews the impacts of shellfish and finfish aquaculture on eelgrass               Zostera marina               , the most widely distributed seagrass species in the northern hemisphere. Shellfish aquaculture can have positive, neutral, and negative effects on eelgrass. Positive interactions can be generated by the filtering activity of cultured bivalves, which may improve water quality and reduce epiphyte loads, and shellfish biodeposits may provide more nutrients to eelgrass and other vegetation. However, negative responses are more commonly reported and can be caused by shading and sedimentation. These negative effects tend to occur directly under and immediately surrounding shellfish farms and rapidly diminish with increasing distance. In contrast to shellfish aquaculture, only one field study has investigated the effects of finfish aquaculture on eelgrass in a temperate setting, and the results were inconclusive. However, many studies have investigated the effects of Mediterranean finfish farms on 2 other species of seagrass (               Posidonia oceanica               and               Cymodocea nodosa               ). These studies reported clear negative interactions, which have been linked to increased nutrient concentrations, sulphides, sedimentation, epiphyte loads, and grazing pressure. It is unknown if these studies are relevant for finfish aquaculture in temperate regions due to differences in environmental conditions, and because the studies focused on different species of seagrass. Thus, further study in a temperate setting is warranted. We conclude by highlighting key research gaps that could help regulators establish unambiguous operational and siting guidelines that minimize the potential for negative interactions between aquaculture and eelgrass.},

  abstract = {The Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) is a highly adaptive demersal, boreal species with a broad distribution on the continental shelves on both sides of the North Atlantic. However, whether the species also uses adjoining deeper water basins as feeding grounds or migration corridors remain unknown. In this study, we aimed to describe the vertical and horizontal distributions of Atlantic cod observed feeding over the northern Fram Strait, between Greenland and Svalbard, and relate this to the prey field and environmental conditions. During surveys in 2014 and 2015, we combined biological sampling of cod, caught in ten pelagic trawls, with environmental data and acoustic registrations. The findings reveal that cod leave the continental-shelf waters and migrate westwards into the deeper water ({$>$}2800~m) of Fram Strait, as they feed on a mesopelagic layer of krill, amphipods, and small fishes. We suggest that leaving the shelf waters to feed over deeper water is a mechanism for the cod to avoid competition for food on their normal feeding grounds over the shelf, or it may demonstrate the phenomenon of a high-risk taker exceeding the limits of its natural demersal environment. The observed migration behavior may be widespread or else linked to ecological features involving physical factors or competition for food, possibly in combination with a large stock of cod. Thus, although the permanent distributions of Atlantic cod are constrained by depth, migration across deeper straits or basins must be considered.},

The existence of the mangrove has increased the values of other coastal and marine resources such as the coastal and marine fisheries by increasing productivity and supporting a wide biological diversity. The deltaic mangrove of Bangladesh is ecologically different from the other, mostly nondeltaic mangroves of the world and is unique also in its floral and faunal assemblage; therefore, a number of endangered plants and animals that are extinct from other parts of the world, are existing in Bangladesh mangrove. However, the mangrove has been under intensive pressure of exploitation for the last few decades which, in addition to direct clearance and conversion have placed the mangrove under extreme threat. Shrimp farming is the most destructive form of resource use the mangrove has been converted to, which contributed significantly to mangrove destruction with a corresponding loss of biological resources. Concerns have been raised among the ecologists, biologists, managers and policy makers since the early 1990s; deliberate destruction of mangrove and unplanned development of coastal aquaculture particularly shrimp aquaculture have been put under extreme criticism and the sustainability has been questioned. The present status of the mangrove resources including mangrove fisheries and aquaculture and management practices have been reviewed in this paper; impacts of different forms of human interventions and resource use have also been discussed. It is suggested that the management options and the policy aspects should be critically reviewed and amended accordingly; beneficiaries and stakeholders at all levels of resource exploitation must take part and contribute to conservation and management. An immediate need for mangrove conservation has been identified. © Springer 2005.},

  abstract = {While environmental performance of cage-based aquaculture is most often monitored through benthic conditions, there may also be requirements that necessitate discrete, pelagic sampling. In the pelagic realm, adequately capturing the spatial and temporal dynamics of interest and attributing causality to aquaculture processes can be extremely challenging. Conditions are seldom ideal, and data adequacy concerns of discrete samples collected at open-water aquaculture sites are not uncommon. Further exploration of these challenges is needed. Herein, we aim to explore considerations for study design, analysis, and data interpretation of discrete pelagic sampling. As examples, we present 2 case studies where limited sampling occurred under conditions of complex pelagic dynamics. A Norwegian case study quantified particle abundance around salmon farms, and aimed to highlight the effects of spatial-temporal variation on sampling design, the need for inclusion of companion parameters, and the benefits of a priori and a posteriori data interpretation strategies. A Canadian case study collected discrete samples to measure ammonium concentrations with continuous current measurements at an Integrated Multi-Trophic Aquaculture (IMTA) farm, to explore issues of complex hydrodynamics, reference site suitability, sampling resolution, data pooling, and post hoc power tests. We further discuss lessons learned and the implications of study design, ambient conditions, physical processes, farm management, statistical analysis, companion parameters, and the potential for confounding effects. Pragmatic consideration of these aspects will ultimately serve to better frame the costs and benefits of discrete pelagic sampling at open-water aquaculture sites.}

  abstract = {The escape of fish from aquaculture is perceived as a threat to wild fish populations. The escapes problem is largely caused by technical and operational failures of fish farming equipment. In Norway, 3.93 million Atlantic salmon Salmo salar, 0.98 million rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss and 1.05 million Atlantic cod Gadus morhua escaped from 2001 to 2009. Salmonids primarily escape after structural failures of containment equipment, while a far greater percentage of cod than salmon escape through holes in the nets. Correlative evidence suggests that after the Norwegian technical standard (NS 9415) for sea-cage farms took effect in 2004, the total number of escaped Atlantic salmon declined from {$>$}600 000 (2001 to 2006) to {$<$}200 000 fish yr-1 (2007 to 2009), despite the total number of salmon held in sea-cages increasing by 44\% during this period. No similar decrease in escaped cod has occurred, suggesting that other measures, such as improved netting materials for sea-cages, are required. In addition to escaping as juveniles or adults, cod may reproduce in seacages, and thus fertilised eggs escape to the environment. The ecological effects of 'escape through spawning' are unclear, and methods to inhibit escape by this mechanism are being explored. To prevent escapes of juvenile and adult fish as sea-cage aquaculture industries develop, we recommend that policy-makers implement a 5 component strategy: (1) establish mandatory reporting of all escape incidents; (2) establish a mechanism to analyse and learn from the mandatory reporting; (3) conduct mandatory, rapid, technical assessments to determine the causes of escape incidents involving more than 10 000 fish; (4) introduce a technical standard for sea-cage aquaculture equipment coupled with an independent mechanism to enforce the standard; and (5) conduct mandatory training of fish farm staff in escape-critical operations and techniques.},

Currents and tidal influences could transport eDNA over great distances, inducing false-positive species detection, leading to inaccurate biodiversity assessments and, ultimately, mismanagement of marine environments. In this study, we determined the ability of eDNA metabarcoding surveys to distinguish localized signals obtained from four marine habitats within a small spatial scale ({$<$}5~km) subject to significant tidal and along-shore water flow. Our eDNA metabarcoding survey detected 86 genera, within 77 families and across 11 phyla using three established metabarcoding assays targeting fish (16S rRNA gene), crustacean (16S rRNA gene) and eukaryotic (cytochrome oxidase subunit 1) diversity. Ordination and cluster analyses for both taxonomic and OTU data sets show distinct eDNA signals between the sampled habitats, suggesting dispersal of eDNA among habitats was limited. Individual taxa with strong habitat preferences displayed localized eDNA signals in accordance with their respective habitat, whereas taxa known to be less habitat-specific generated more ubiquitous signals. Our data add to evidence that eDNA metabarcoding surveys in marine environments detect a broad range of taxa that are spatially discrete. Our work also highlights that refinement of assay choice is essential to realize the full potential of eDNA metabarcoding surveys in marine biodiversity monitoring programs.},

  abstract = {The utility of environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding surveys to accurately detect species depends on the degree of DNA dispersal. Multiple marine studies have observed only minimal eDNA transport by horizontal water movement across small spatial scales, leading to the conclusion that spatially specific eDNA signals accurately resemble in‐field species assemblages along a horizontal axis. Marine communities, however, are also structured vertically according to depth. In marine environments displaying permanent water stratification, vertical zonation patterns may be more apparent and present on smaller spatial scales (i.e., meters) than horizontal community structuring. The scale at which eDNA signals differ along a vertical transect and the accuracy of eDNA metabarcoding in revealing naturally stratified communities have yet to be assessed. In this study, we determined the ability of eDNA metabarcoding surveys to distinguish vertically localized community assemblages. To test this, we sampled three vertical transects along a steep rock wall at three depths (0 m, 4 m, 15 m), covering two distinct communities that were separated by near‐permanent water column stratification in the form of a strong halocline at \textasciitilde 3 m. Using three metabarcoding assays, our eDNA metabarcoding survey detected 54 taxa, across 46 families and 7 phyla, including 19 fish, 15 crustacean, and 8 echinoderm species. Ordination and cluster analyses show distinct eDNA signals across the halocline for all three replicate transects, suggesting that vertical dispersal of eDNA between communities was limited. Furthermore, eDNA signals of individual taxa were only retrieved within their observed vertical distribution, providing biological validation for the obtained results. Our results demonstrate, for the first time, the need to take into consideration oceanographic (e.g. water column stratification) and biological processes (e.g. vertical community structuring) when designing sampling strategies for marine eDNA metabarcoding surveys.

The results of previous studies suggest that the decay rate of eDNA varies depending on the length of DNA fragments. To examine this hypothesis, we compared temporal change in copy number of long eDNA fragments (719~bp) with that of short eDNA fragments (127~bp). First, we isolated rearing water from a target fish species, Japanese Jack Mackerel (Trachurus japonicus), and then quantified the copy number of the long and short eDNA fragments in 1~L water samples after isolating the water from the fish. Long DNA fragments showed a higher decay rate than short fragments. Next, we measured the eDNA copy numbers of long and short DNA fragments using field samples, and compared them with fish biomass as measured by echo intensity. Although a previous study suggested that short eDNA fragments could be overestimated because of nontarget eDNA from a nearby fish market and carcasses, the eDNA concentrations of long fragments were correlated with echo intensity. This suggests that the concentration of longer eDNA fragments reflects fish biomass more accurately than the previous study by removing the effects of the fish market and carcasses. The length-related differences in eDNA have a substantial potential to improve estimation of species biomass.},

We selected the V9 region of the 18S rDNA gene (18S V9), primarily because of its broad range among eukaryotes. Our results produced more detailed spatial patterns in the study area previously categorized (inner bay, main channel of the bay and outer bay) by Kim et al. (2019). Specifically, the outer bay zone was clearly identified by CCA using genus-level identification of aquatic organisms based on meta-barcoding data. We also found significant relationships between environmental factors. Therefore, eDNA monitoring based on meta-barcoding approach holds great potential as a complemental monitoring tool to identify spatial taxonomic distribution patterns in coastal areas.},

The results showed that the eDNA shedding rate increased at higher water temperature and larger fish biomass, and the eDNA decay rate also increased at higher temperature and fish biomass.

We used data on cod and prey distributions and cod diet col lected during the Barents Sea ecosystem survey. Local prey use, feeding success, spatial displace ment and spatial overlap between cod ({$>$}2 yr) and prey (capelin, herring, polar cod, shrimp and macrozooplankton) were analysed. While prey species were found in spatially segregated habi tats, cod were widely distributed, except the deepest parts of the Barents Sea where shrimps pre vailed. Local diet reflected local prey availability. Cod abundance was higher in areas occupied by capelin and herring and lower in the northeastern areas occupied by polar cod. Feeding success increased with the local abundance of capelin and polar cod. Capelin were a targeted prey, and cod fed efficiently on capelin in the areas where they overlapped. Herring overlapped with cod, but feeding success did not increase with herring abundance, suggesting that herring might escape predation. Although feeding success increased with local polar cod abundance, polar cod had a spatial refuge in the northeastern part, which cod did not enter. Our analyses imply that the cod were spatially constrained and that their prey differed in suitability. © Inter-Research 2012.},

Conservation professionals can choose from a considerable number of modelling techniques, but there has been relatively little evaluation of predictive performance, data requirements, or type of inference of these models. Empirical data for woodland caribou               Rangifer tarandus caribou               was used to examine four species distribution models, namely a qualitative habitat suitability index and quantitative resource selection function, Mahalanobis distance and ecological niche models.

The similarity of species distribution maps among the four modelling approaches was also quantified. All of the quantitative species distribution models were good predictors of the validation data set, but the spatial distribution of mapped habitats differed considerably among models. These results suggest that choice of model and variable set could influence the identification of areas for conservation emphasis. Model choice may be limited by the type of species locations or desired inference. Conservation professionals should choose a model and variable set based on the question, the ecology of the species and the availability of requisite data.},

  abstract = {Biodiversity is essential to human well-being, but people have been reducing biodiversity throughout human history. Loss of species and degradation of ecosystems are likely to further accelerate in the coming years. Our understanding of this crisis is now clear, and world leaders have pledged to avert it. Nonetheless, global goals to reduce the rate of biodiversity loss have mostly not been achieved. However, many examples of conservation success show that losses can be halted and even reversed. Building on these lessons to turn the tide of biodiversity loss will require bold and innovative action to transform historical relationships between human populations and nature.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Recent genetic studies, meta‐analyses, and retrospective analyses have documented reduced productivity of wild salmon and steelhead               Oncorhynchus mykiss               that interbreed with hatchery‐reared fish, raising concerns about the long‐term viability and recovery of at‐risk stocks. In 2007, the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife discontinued a Coho Salmon               Oncorhynchus kisutch               hatchery program at the Salmon River to support recovery of a wild Coho Salmon population in the Oregon Coast Evolutionarily Significant Unit. This decision constituted a unique management “experiment,” allowing for direct measurement of the wild population's response after the discontinuation of a decades‐old hatchery program. We used a before–after, control–impact design to examine whether selected viability metrics of the naturally produced population in the Salmon River changed after the hatchery program ended. We compared metrics for the 2006–2013 broods, representing periods after the hatchery program ended, to those for the 1995–2005 broods, when the hatchery program was still releasing 200,000 smolts annually. We also examined neighboring populations during similar time periods to account for changes or variation due to other factors. Although hatchery‐origin spawners previously had accounted for most of the adults returning to the Salmon River, the naturally produced population did not collapse, and two viability metrics improved significantly after the Coho Salmon hatchery program ended: (1) adult abundance increased and (2) spawn timing expanded and moved closer to the historical timing. Recruits‐to‐spawner ratios in the Salmon River, although initially low, are now approximately equal to those of neighboring populations. The results indicate that hatchery closure can be an effective strategy to promote wild population recovery. However, considerable variability in population trends and environmental conditions will require continued monitoring to verify the long‐term resilience and viability of the wild population.},

  abstract = {A number of 41 papers dealing with the benthic effects of fish farming were reviewed and the values of the variables studied were extracted to be used in a meta-analysis of effects. The papers used covered a wide range of farmed species, geographic regions, management practices and specific site characteristics (e.g., depth, exposure, and sediment type). Therefore, the total data-set may not be considered as biased towards a particular set of conditions as is often the case with data collected in a single study. More than 120 biological and geochemical variables were monitored, occasionally using different sampling and analytical protocols for the same variables. The rank correlation analysis between all possible pairs of variables in the data set showed a large number of significant positive or negative correlations, reflecting the response of these variables to benthic organic enrichment. The use of stepwise regression showed that most biological and geochemical variables are determined by a combination of distance from the farm with bottom depth and/or latitude. Results of stepwise regression, repeated separately for each type of sediment, showed that although the general pattern was similar among different types of sediments, the coefficients varied considerably indicating changes of the distance affected by settling particulate organic material for different sediment types. The overall conclusion is that the complicated interactions between variables and the lack of data, such as current speed, induce difficulties in setting common or uniform environmental quality standards for benthic effects of fish farming and these should take into account the existing considerable differences between geographic regions, depth zones and sediment types. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract = {Trace element concentrations in sediment were investigated at four fish farms in the Eastern Mediterranean Sea. Fish farms effects were negligible beyond 25-50. m from the edge of the cages. Based on elemental distribution, sediments from the farms were separated into coarse oxidized and silty reduced ones. Fish feed is richer in P, Zn and Cd than reference and impacted stations. Comparison among impacted stations and the respective reference stations shows that, in anoxic sediments, all elements had higher concentrations at the impacted stations than at reference stations while in oxic sediments, many elemental concentrations were lower at impacted stations than at reference stations. The behavior of elements and therefore their distribution is affected by changes in sediment grain size, organic content and redox regime. Elements in sediments around fish farms can be clustered into five groups according to these environmental variables. In silty and anoxic sediments, element concentrations were higher than in coarse and oxic ones. Several approaches were used to assess potential sediment toxicity (enrichment factors, geoaccumulation indices, contamination factors) as well as to assess the potential danger to aquatic life (Sediment Quality Guidelines, SQG). Cu, Zn and Fe can cause from threshold to extreme effects on aquatic life in anoxic, fine-grained sediments and As can cause threshold effects in all types of sediment around fish farms. Other elements (Cr, Pb, Mn) can also cause unwanted effects when compounded with elevated background levels. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

Concentrations of metals and other elements were measured in macrofaunal taxa and in fish tissues (muscle, liver, gills, bone, gonad, stomach, intestine, and stomach content).

Macroinvertebrates accumulated lower concentrations of most metals and elements than their respective sediment, except As, P, Na, Zn and Cd. Elemental concentrations of benthic organisms increased with increasing sediment metal content, except Cd, and with \% silt, refractory organic matter and chlorophyll-a of sediment due to the influence of sediment geochemistry on metal bioavailability. Tolerant species were found to accumulate higher concentrations of most metals and elements, except for Cd, than equilibrium species. The ecological and morphological characteristics of the benthic invertebrates can affect the bioaccumulation of metals and elements in macrobenthos.

  abstract = {Abstract             A shift towards ecosystem-based management in recent decades has led to new analytical tools such as end-to-end marine ecosystem models. End-to-end models are complex and typically simulate full ecosystems from oceanography to foodwebs and fisheries, operate on a spatial framework, and link to physical oceanographic models. Most end-to-end approaches allow multiple ways to implement human behaviours involving fishery catch, fleet movement, or other impacts such as nutrient loading or climate change effects. Though end-to-end ecosystem models were designed specifically for marine management, their novelty makes them unfamiliar to most decision makers. Before such models can be applied within the context of marine management decisions, additional levels of vetting will be required, and a dialogue with decision makers must be initiated. Here we summarize a review of an Atlantis end-to-end model, which involved a multi-day, expert review panel with local and international experts, convened to challenge models and data used in the management context. We propose nine credibility and quality control standards for end-to-end models intended to inform management, and suggest two best practice guidelines for any end-to-end modelling application. We offer our perspectives (as recent test subjects or “guinea pigs”) on how a review could be motivated and structured and on the evaluation criteria that should be used, in the most specific terms possible.},

A transect of stations in the vicinity of the cages and a control station in each area were sampled for macrofauna and geochemical variables during July, October, and April. Redox potential in the sediment decreased under and near the cages but reached negative values only at the silty sediment site. Organic carbon and nitrogen content of the sediment near the cages increased by a factor of 1.5-5 and ATP content by 4-28 compared with the control. Azoic zones were not encountered, but the macrofaunal community was affected up to 25 m from the edge of the cages. At the coarse sediment sites, abundance and biomass under the cages were 10 times higher than at the control. Diversity indicated that the ecotone was in the vicinity of 25 m from the cages in all cases. Capitella cf. capitata dominated macrofauna up to 10 m from the cages in two fish farms, whereas the third was dominated by Protodorvillea kefersteini. Similar patterns of succession from the impacted to the normal zones were found, although macrofaunal composition differed among sites. Seasonal variability in geochemistry and macrofauna was higher in proximity of the cages. The results indicate that impacts of fish farming on benthos in the Mediterranean vary considerably depending on site characteristics. © 2000 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Multispecies models have existed in a fisheries context since at least the 1970s, but despite much exploration, advancement, and consideration of multispecies models, there remain limited examples of their operational use in fishery management. Given that species and fleet interactions are inherently multispecies problems and the push towards ecosystem-based fisheries management, the lack of more regular operational use is both surprising and compelling. We identify impediments hampering the regular operational use of multispecies models and provide recommendations to address those impediments. These recommendations are: (1) engage stakeholders and managers early and often; (2) improve messaging and communication about the various uses of multispecies models; (3) move forward with multispecies management under current authorities while exploring more inclusive governance structures and flexible decision-making frameworks for handling tradeoffs; (4) evaluate when a multispecies modelling approach may be more appropriate; (5) tailor the multispecies model to a clearly defined purpose; (6) develop interdisciplinary solutions to promoting multispecies model applications; (7) make guidelines available for multispecies model review and application; and (8) ensure code and models are well documented and reproducible. These recommendations draw from a global assemblage of subject matter experts who participated in a workshop entitled “Multispecies Modeling Applications in Fisheries Management”.},

  abstract = {Concerns about the Chinese technology giant Huawei as the potential supplier of 5G technology for next generation wireless networks have generated lively debate among cybersecurity community. This paper discusses the strategic and legal issues raised by potential reliance on Chinese technology in the rollout of 5G, explores the national responses, and offers recommendations for a balanced approach. The paper Huawei, 5G, and China as a Security Threat written by Kadri Kaska, Henrik Beckvard and Tomáš Minárik, researchers at the CCDCOE, recognises that it is rational to require the highest possible security assurance from 5G technology used for critical communication. The pursuit for technological innovation is accompanied by concerns about cybersecurity with implications to a broader national security context. Possible loss or interruption of availability, integrity or confidentiality in critical networks could have a significant adverse effect on society. Many countries have expressed their concerns about the potential consequences of ties between Chinese communications technology companies and its intelligence services, reinforced by China’s political and legal environment requiring cooperation with intelligence agencies. Accordingly, 5G rollout needs to be recognised as a strategic rather than merely a technological choice. The authors claim that viable alternatives to Huawei technology are necessary to preserve flexibility of choice and to prevent being trapped with one supplier without a way out. Solid accountability, transparency, and risk mitigation mechanisms are the essential minimum in order to benefit from the socioeconomic benefit of 5G without jeopardising national security. To this end, R\&D investment and strengthening regional industry are not purely issues of global competitiveness, but should also be considered – and more importantly, pursued – for their security dimension.

  abstract = {This study evaluates five benthic indicators (total abundance, number of taxa, redox potential, total free sulfides, total organic matter) and ten biotic indices (Margalef's d, Peilou's J', Shannon H', AMBI, M-AMBI, MEDOCC, BENTIX, BOPA, ITI, BQI), to identify those that best define organic enrichment gradients under different flow regimes. Performance was measured against Enrichment Stage (ES), a continuous variable characterising the full range of sediment conditions (natural to azoic). None of the 15 metrics were able to consistently discriminate over the full enrichment gradient for both flow environments. The most versatile indices were BQI {$>$} M-AMBI {$>$} AMBI {$>$} Log(N) {$>$} BENTIX. Of these, M-AMBI best catered for different flow environments, while the BQI was the most effective under highly enriched conditions. Under strong enrichment, i.e. when macrofauna abundance is in decline, changes in redox, sulfides, number of taxa and abundance were reasonably clear. However, the more complex biotic indices were relatively insensitive at this level, highlighting a limited applicability beyond the 'peak of opportunists' (PO). Conversely, in high flow regimes, some of the biological indicators were relatively sensitive to low-to-moderate levels of enrichment that were not well discerned by the physico-chemical variables. A useful subset of variables for assessing enrichment status is recommended, comprising two of the best performing biotic indices that are based on alternative/independent classification schemes (i.e. EG's and ES50 0.05), total abundance, to aid in discerning PO, and a geochemical variable (redox or S 2-). Inconsistencies between metrics were found to be more significant than the variability surrounding the predictive capacity of individual indicators, and as a result there is a risk of ES misclassification where only a single index is used. Whilst there is a recognised need to use combinations of indicators, this study also stresses the importance of focusing on a few regionally validated measures and down-weighting the importance placed on any that are not. Additionally, although using a combination of different indicators may produce a 'safe' average result, it may be inefficient, and the averaging effect has the potential to mask extreme conditions. Hence, there remains a need for expert judgement to select and appropriately weight indicator variables, to identify any erroneous results, and to reliably assess ecological quality status. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

However, eDNA data are rarely used in decision‐making contexts, mainly due to uncertainty around (1) data interpretation and (2) whether and how molecular tools dovetail with existing management efforts. We address these challenges by jointly modeling eDNA detection via qPCR and traditional trap data to estimate the density of invasive European green crab (               Carcinus maenas               ), a species for which, historically, baited traps have been used for both detection and control. Our analytical framework simultaneously quantifies uncertainty in both detection methods and provides a robust way of integrating different data streams into management processes. Moreover, the joint model makes clear the marginal information benefit of adding eDNA (or any other) additional data type to an existing monitoring program, offering a path to optimizing sampling efforts for species of management interest. Here, we document green crab eDNA beyond the previously known invasion front and find that the value of eDNA data dramatically increases with low population densities and low traditional sampling effort, as is often the case at leading‐edge locations. We also highlight the detection limits of the molecular assay used in this study, as well as scenarios under which eDNA sampling is unlikely to improve existing management efforts.},

In general, eDNA studies that rely on amplicon sequencing may detect hundreds of species present in a sampled environment, but the resulting species composition can be idiosyncratic, reflecting species’ true biomass abundances poorly or not at all. Here, we use a set of simulations to develop a mechanistic understanding of the processes leading to the kinds of results common in mixed-template PCR-based (metabarcoding) studies. In particular, we focus on the effects of PCR cycle number and primer amplification efficiency on the results of diversity metrics in sequencing studies. We then show that proportional indices of amplicon reads capture trends in taxon biomass with high accuracy, particularly where amplification efficiency is high (median correlation up to 0.97). Our results explain much of the observed behavior of PCR-based studies, and lead to recommendations for best practices in the field.},

As use‐cases multiply and scientific consensus grows regarding the value of eDNA analysis, public agencies have an opportunity to decide how and where eDNA data fit into their mandates. Within the United States, many federal and state agencies are individually using eDNA data in various applications and developing relevant scientific expertise. A national strategy for eDNA implementation would capitalize on recent scientific developments, providing a common set of next‐generation tools for natural resource management and public health protection. Such a strategy would avoid patchwork and possibly inconsistent guidelines in different agencies, smoothing the way for efficient uptake of eDNA data in management. Because eDNA analysis is already in widespread use in both ocean and freshwater settings, we focus here on applications in these environments.

  abstract = {Abstract Lumpfish (Cyclopterus lumpus) is a high latitude species most abundant in Arctic and sub-Arctic waters of the North Atlantic. Vertical behaviour of this fish is unclear as it is often caught by both pelagic and demersal trawls. To gain greater insight into its behaviour, 41 female lumpfish caught during the Icelandic Groundfish Survey (IGFS) in March were tagged with data storage tags (DSTs); the IGFS finishes ∼1 week before the beginning of the lumpfish fishing season (20 March). Data retrieved from returned tags were compared with information on depth and distribution of catches of lumpfish from the IGFS. Thirteen tags were returned with days at liberty ranging from 20 to 61 d. Maximum depth recorded was 308 m (maximum depth of the tag) but based upon interpolation of temperature recordings, one fish may have descended to ∼418 m. Lumpfish displayed a range of vertical behaviours termed demersal, surface, and pelagic. During March, most exhibited either demersal or pelagic behaviour but the time spent in surface behaviour increased from March to April. During demersal behaviour, depth was rarely constant indicating the fish were not stationary. Both DST and catch data from the IGFS indicate that lumpfish exhibit diel patterns in vertical behaviour. As lumpfish frequently exhibit demersal behaviour, the use of the IGFS to monitor changes in abundance is justified. As lumpfish spend a significant amount of time in both the pelagic and demersal zone, they should be considered as a semi-pelagic (or semi-demersal) fish during this life stage/time of year.},

  abstract = {Atlantic cod is composed of multiple migratory and stationary populations widely distributed in the North Atlantic Ocean. The Northeast Arctic cod (NEAC) population in the Barents Sea undertakes annual spawning migrations to the northern Norwegian coast. Although spawning occurs sympatrically with the stationary Norwegian coastal cod (NCC), phenotypic and genetic differences between NEAC and NCC are maintained. In this study, we resolve the enigma by revealing the mechanisms underlying these differences. Extended linkage disequilibrium (LD) and population divergence were demonstrated in a 17.4-Mb region on linkage group 1 (LG1) based on genotypes of 494 SNPs from 192 parents of farmed families of NEAC, NCC or NEACxNCC crosses. Linkage analyses revealed two adjacent inversions within this region that repress meiotic recombination in NEACxNCC crosses. We identified a NEAC-specific haplotype consisting of 186 SNPs that was fixed in NEAC sampled from the Barents Sea, but segregating under Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium in eight NCC stocks. Comparative genomic analyses determine the NEAC configuration of the inversions to be the derived state and date it to \textasciitilde 1.6–2.0~Mya. The haplotype block harbours 763 genes, including candidates regulating swim bladder pressure, haem synthesis and skeletal muscle organization conferring adaptation to long-distance migrations and vertical movements down to large depths. Our results suggest that the migratory ecotype experiences strong directional selection for the two adjacent inversions on LG1. Despite interbreeding between NEAC and NCC, the inversions are maintaining genetic differentiation, and we hypothesize the co-occurrence of multiple adaptive alleles forming a ‘supergene’ in the NEAC population.},

After arguing that species are sets and not individuals, I proceed to outline briefly some defects of the biological species concept. I draw the general moral that similar shortcomings arise for other popular views of the nature of species. These shortcomings arise because the legitimate interests of biology are diverse, and these diverse interests are reflected in different legitimate approaches to the classification of organisms. In the final section, I show briefly how the pluralistic approach can help to illuminate some areas of biological and philosophical dispute.},

Sober's comments divide into three parts. He attempts to show that species are not sets; he responds to my critique of David Hull's thesis that species are individuals; and he offers some arguments for the claim that species are “chunks of the genealogical nexus.” I consider each of these objections in turn, arguing that each of them fails.

  abstract = {Biomass assesment of fish stocks is a difficult task that often involves costly fisheries trawl surveys. Trawl surveys rarely return replicate samples, as trawling attempts are expensive and difficult to reproduce. Furthermore, traditional benthic trawling is often detrimental to habitats and the organisms associated with the sea bottom. The rapidly developing field of environmental DNA (eDNA) analysis offers a new approach to non-invasive monitoring of fish. In the present study, we develop and test species-specific primers and probes for qPCR detection of eDNA from Atlantic herring (Clupea harengus), Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua), European flounder (Platichthys flesus), European plaice (Pleuronectes platessa), and Atlantic mackerel (Scomber scombrus) in the Baltic Sea. A recently published qPCR system was applied for European eel (Anguilla anguilla). Filtered water samples were collected during a stratified benthic trawl survey, enabling parallel comparisons of eDNA concentrations with biomass caught by trawling. No significant correlation was found between eDNA concentrations and the biomass of fish caught by the trawl, although an association was observed between the measured concentrations of eDNA and the known distributions and main abundances of cod, herring, plaice and flounder. This indicates that while eDNA concentrations may not be directly comparable to results from existing methods – likely because aquatic eDNA concentrations are not controlled by the same combinations of factors as e.g. trawl biomass catch – eDNA analysis could prove a useful supplement for monitoring fish stocks in the future.},

The species appears instead to be subdivided into partially isolated populations, with some evidence for isolation by distance. However, there is a dichotomy between transatlantic sample comparisons and those within a regional current system, even when geographic distance is similar. Calculating geographic distance along the flow of ocean currents gave a more linear correlation with genetic differentiation than straight-line geographic distances, suggesting that gene flow follows ocean currents. We hypothesize that gene flow is mediated by drift of eggs and larvae with ocean currents, a hypothesis that is consistent with the extended pelagic phase of Greenland halibut larvae. This implies an important role for ocean currents in shaping the genetic structure of this and potentially other deep-sea species.},

While it has proven to be valuable for clinical studies, it has failed to be widely adopted for environmental studies but despite some limitations, ddPCR may represent a better option than classical qPCR for environmental samples. Due to the complexity of the chemical and biological composition of environmental samples, protocols tailored to clinical studies are not appropriate, and results are difficult to interpret. We used environmental DNA samples originating from field studies to determine a protocol for environmental samples. Samples included field soils which had been inoculated with the soil fungus Rhizophagus irregularis (environmental positive control), field soils that had not been inoculated and the targeted fungus was not naturally present (environmental negative control), and root samples from both field categories. To control for the effect of soil inhibitors, we also included DNA samples of an organismal control extracted from pure fungal spores (organismal positive control). Finally, we included a no-template control consisting only of the PCR reaction reagents and nuclease free water instead of template DNA. Using original data, we examined which factors contribute to poor resolution in root and soil samples and propose best practices to ensure accuracy and repeatability. Furthermore, we evaluated manual and automatic threshold determination methods and we propose a novel protocol based on multiple controls that is more appropriate for environmental samples.},

This could reflect a genuine lack of simple gradients in beta diversity, or a lack of agreement as to just what constitutes beta diversity. Unfortunately, a large number of approaches have been applied to the investigation of variation in beta diversity, which potentially makes comparisons of the findings difficult.                                                     We review 24 measures of beta diversity for presence/absence data (the most frequent form of data to which such measures are applied) that have been employed in the literature, express many of them for the first time in common terms, and compare some of their basic properties.                                                     Four groups of measures are distinguished, with a fundamental distinction arising between ‘broad sense’ measures incorporating differences in composition attributable to species richness gradients, and ‘narrow sense’ measures that focus on compositional differences independent of such gradients. On a number of occasions on which the former have been employed in the literature the latter may have been more appropriate, and there are many situations in which consideration of both kinds of measures would be valuable.                                                                          We particularly recommend (i) considering beta diversity measures in terms of matching/mismatching components (usually denoted                     a                     ,                     b                     and                     c                     ) and thereby identifying the contribution of different sources of variation in species composition, and (ii) the use of ternary plots to express the relationship between the values of these measures and of the components, and as a way of understanding patterns in beta diversity.},

There is an ongoing need to make the acoustic identification of marine species more correct and objective and thereby reduce the uncertainty of acoustic abundance estimates. In our work, data from multi-frequency echosounders working simultaneously with nearly identical and overlapping acoustic beams are processed stepwise in a modular sequence to improve data, detect schools and categorize acoustic targets by means of the Large Scale Survey System software (LSSS). Categorization is based on the use of an acoustic feature library whose main components are the relative frequency responses. The results of the categorization are translated into acoustic abundance of species. The method is tested on acoustic data from the Barents Sea, the Norwegian Sea and the North Sea, where the target species were capelin (Mallotus villosus L.), Atlantic mackerel (Scomber scombrus L.) and sandeel (Ammodytes marinus L.), respectively. Manual categorization showed a high conformity with automatic categorization for all surveys, especially for schools.},

  abstract = {High-latitude fjord environments are undergoing dynamic seasonal changes, affecting spatio-temporal patterns in planktonic abundances. To investigate how physical gradients impact sub-Arctic planktonic protists ({$>$} 20~μm), a seasonal transect study was performed in 2013 during three periods of planktonic succession: spring, summer, and autumn. The samples were collected from the glacier-fjord-ocean transect in SW Greenland using two complementary sampling methods, i.e. net hauls (20-μm net) and Niskin bottles. The key drivers of the distribution of planktonic groups and dominant taxa were hydrographic properties (defined as ‘time’, salinity, and temperature) reflecting the area’s seasonally changing circulation system. Cold and relatively saline waters in spring favoured the single haptophyte species Phaeocystis cf. pouchetii, while in summer, fresher waters influenced by glacial discharge favoured diatoms, followed by dinoflagellates and predatory ciliates in autumn. Our findings reveal a monodominant structure among the planktonic protists observed in each key sub-region and in each season. (1) Gedaniella boltonii (spring) was associated with inner fjord upwelling, (2) Chaetoceros sp. (summer) and Chaetoceros cf. socialis (autumn) were linked to ‘glacial meltwater’ circulation in the main fjord, and (3) Thalassiosira poroseriata (summer) and Skeletonema sp. (autumn) characterized warm and relatively saline offshore waters influenced by the West Greenland Current. The observed spatio-temporal patterns were linked to changes in hydrographic regimes driven by the interplay between the melting of the Greenland Ice Sheet and inflows of offshore, Atlantic-sourced waters.},

However, there is a lack of knowledge about the effect of fish farming on this process. We evaluated the effect of fish farming on shell-hash accumulation on sediments in three fish farms in the Western Mediterranean in Spain. On the one hand, coverage of non-degraded shell on the seabed was estimated using an underwater camera attached to a frame of 1 × 1 m. On the other hand, superficial sediment samples were taken by a Van-Veen grab, and from a subsample, shell-hash was sorted at the laboratory, dried, and weighted. A significant increase of shells on sediment was detected under fish farms compared with the other treatments, with average values of 53 g kg-1, and 1.12\% of cover. Shell-hash at zones close to the fish farm cages (Zone of Influence located between 40 to 60 m from the closest cage) did not show statistical differences compared to the reference zones, 300–500 m away from the concession limits, but the shell cover showed statistical differences. Fish farming activities produce a local increase in the sedimentation rate of shells under the cages. The derived ecological consequences of this accumulation need to be further studied.},

The macroplastic categories and abundances were determined by video monitoring, detecting the majority of elements (78\%), including ropes, nets and fibres, a basket trap and a cable tie, close to the facilities, which were not exclusively linked to fish farming but also to fishing activities. Concentrations of microplastics ({$<$}5 mm) ranged from 0 to 213 particles/kg dry weight sediment with higher values in sites directly under the influence of the fish farms. Most particles (27.8\%) were within the size fraction from 1.1 to 2.0 mm and fibre was the most common shape with 62.2\%. The Infrared spectroscopy analysis showed that PE and PP were the predominant types of polymers analysed. In addition, changes in the enthalpy of melting (ΔHm (J/g)) and the degree of crystallinity indicate degradation of the microplastics analysed. This study shows that, in the studied fish farms, levels of microplastic pollution can be one order of magnitude lower compared to other areas suffering other anthropogenic pressures from the same or similar regions. Nevertheless, more research effort is needed to get concluding results.},

  abstract = {Kelp forests are productive coastal ecosystems that provide a range of ecosystem services. Mapping the distribution and area occupied by kelp forests is a critical step to identify their ecosystem functions and services, including their role in the carbon cycle, and to detect changes in their distribution. We compiled quantitative data of the dominant genera               Laminaria               and               Saccharina               across the Nordic region, allowing us to separate kelp forests (areas with dense or moderately dense kelp coverage) from occurrences of single or few individuals. By fitting boosted regression trees to the compiled data, we modelled and predicted the distribution of kelp forests across the Nordic region. Despite the large scale of the analyses, the models captured well the kelps’ environmental affinities and predicted the presence of kelp forests with high accuracy. Dense kelp forests are found along the rocky shores of all the Nordic countries, except in the brackish Baltic Sea, with largest areas in Norway, Greenland and Iceland. The results of this study set the scene for future studies on the importance of kelp forests in the Nordic region, including their contribution to the marine carbon budget.},

  abstract = {Twenty-nine years of Arctic sea ice outflow into the Greenland and Barents Seas are summarized. Outflow is computed at three passages: Fram Strait, between Svalbard and Franz Josef Land (S-FJL), and between Franz Josef Land and Severnaya Zemlya (FJL-SZ). Ice drift at the flux gates has been reprocessed using a consistent and updated time series of passive microwave brightness temperature and ice concentration (IC) fields. Over the record, the mean annual area outflow at the Fram Strait is 706(113) × 103 km2; it was highest in 1994/95 (1002 × 103 km2) when the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) index was near its 29-yr peak. The strength of the "Transpolar Drift Stream" (TDS) was high during the late 1980s through the mid-1990s. There is no statistically significant trend in the Fram Strait area flux. Even though there is a positive trend in the gradient of cross-strait sea level pressure, the outflow has not increased because of a negative trend in IC. Seasonally, the area outflow during recent summers (in 2005 and 2007) has been higher ({$>$} 2ø from the mean) than average, contributing to the decline of summer ice coverage. Without updated ice thickness estimates, the best estimate of mean annual volume flux (between 1991 and 1999) stands at ∼2200 km3 yr-1 (∼0.07 Sv: Sv ≡ 106 m3 s-1). Net annual outflow at the S-FJL passage is 37(39) × 103 km2; the large outflow of multiyear ice in 2002-03, marked by an area and volume outflow of 141 × 103 km2 and ∼300 km3, was unusual over the record. At the FJL-SZ passage, there is a mean annual inflow of 103(93) × 103 km2 of seasonal ice into the Arctic. While the recent pattern of winter Arctic circulation and sea level pressure (SLP) has nearly reverted to its conditions typical of the 1980s, the summer has not. Compared to the 1980s, the recent summer SLP distributions show much lower SLPs (2-3 hPa) over much of the Arctic. Overall, there is a strengthening of the summer TDS. Examination of the exchanges between the Pacific and Atlantic sectors shows a long-term trend that favors the summer advection of sea ice toward the Atlantic associated with a shift in the mean summer circulation patterns. © 2009 American Meteorological Society.},

Water temperature is known to influence the metabolism of fish and consequently could strongly affect eDNA release rate. As water temperature varies in temperate regions (both seasonally and geographically), the unknown effect of water temperature on eDNA concentrations poses practical limitations on quantifying fish populations using eDNA from water samples. This study aimed to clarify how water temperature and the eDNA capture method alter the relation- ships between eDNA concentration and fish abundance/biomass. Water samples (1 L) were collected from 30 aquaria including triplicate of 0, 5, 10, 15 and 20 Brook Charr specimens at two different temperatures (7 °C and 14 °C). Water samples were filtered with five different types of filters. The eDNA concentration obtained by quantitative PCR (qPCR) varied significantly with fish abundance and biomass and types of filters (mixed-design ANOVA, P {$<$} 0.001). Results also show that fish released more eDNA in warm water than in cold water and that eDNA concentration bet- ter reflects fish abundance/biomass at high temperature. From a technical standpoint, higher levels of eDNA were captured with glass fibre (GF) filters than with mixed cellulose ester (MCE) filters and support the importance of ade- quate filters to quantify fish abundance based on the eDNA method. This study supports the importance of includ- ing water temperature in fish abundance/biomass prediction models based on eDNA.},

This study evaluates the potential of aquatic environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding to detect Arctic coastal biodiversity changes and characterizes the localspatio-temporal distribution of eDNA in two locations. We extracted and amplifiedeDNA using two COI primer pairs from ∼80 water samples that were collected acrosstwo Canadian Arctic ports, Churchill and Iqaluit, based on optimized sampling andpreservation methods for remote regions surveys. Results demonstrate that aquaticeDNA surveys have the potential to document large-scale Arctic biodiversity changeby providing a rapid overview of coastal metazoan biodiversity, detecting nonindigenous species, and allowing sampling in both open water and under the ice cover bylocal northern-based communities. We show that DNA sequences of ∼50\% of knownCanadian Arctic species and potential invaders are currently present in public databases. A similar proportion of operational taxonomic units was identified at the species level with eDNA metabarcoding, for a total of 181 species identified at bothsites. Despite the cold and well-mixed coastal environment, species composition wasvertically heterogeneous, in part due to river inflow in the estuarine ecosystem, anddiffered between the water column and tide pools. Thus, COI-based eDNA metabarcoding may quickly improve large-scale Arctic biomonitoring using eDNA, but wecaution that aquatic eDNA sampling needs to be standardized over space and time toaccurately evaluate community structure changes.},

The rate at which eDNA decays has been widely studied but at present it is difficult to disentangle study‐specific effects from factors that universally affect eDNA degradation. To address this, a systematic review and meta‐analysis was conducted on aquatic eDNA studies. Analysis revealed eDNA decayed faster at higher temperatures and in marine environments (as opposed to freshwater). DNA type (mitochondrial or nuclear) and fragment length did not affect eDNA decay rate, although a preference for {$<$}200~bp sequences in the available literature means this relationship was not assessed with longer sequences (e.g. {$>$}800~bp). At present, factors such as ultraviolet light, pH, and microbial load lacked sufficient studies to feature in the meta‐analysis. Moving forward, we advocate researching these factors to further refine our understanding of eDNA decay in aquatic environments.},

  abstract = {Human impact on marine benthic communities has traditionally been assessed using visible morphological traits and has focused on the macrobenthos, whereas the ecologically important organisms of the meio- and microbenthos have received less attention. DNA metabarcoding offers an alternative to this approach and enables a larger fraction of the biodiversity in marine sediments to be monitored in a cost-efficient manner. Although this methodology remains poorly standardised and challenged by biases inherent to rRNA copy number variation, DNA extraction, PCR, and limitations related to taxonomic identification, it has been shown to be semi-quantitative and useful for comparing taxon abundances between samples. Here, we evaluate the effect of replicating genomic DNA extraction in order to counteract small scale spatial heterogeneity and improve diversity and community structure estimates in metabarcoding-based monitoring. For this purpose, we used ten technical replicates from three different marine sediment samples. The effect of sequence depth was also assessed, and in silico pooling of DNA extraction replicates carried out in order to maintain the number of reads constant. Our analyses demonstrated that both sequencing depth and DNA extraction replicates could improve diversity estimates as well as the ability to separate samples with different characteristics. We could not identify a “sufficient” replicate number or sequence depth, where further improvements had a less significant effect. Based on these results, we consider replication an attractive alternative to directly increasing the amount of sample used for DNA extraction and strongly recommend it for future metabarcoding studies and routine assessments of sediment biodiversity.},

Bacterial communities were the most responsive to O\&G activities, followed by Foraminifera, and macro-fauna (the latter assessed by morphology). The molecular approach enabled detection of hydrocarbon degrading taxa such as the bacteria Alcanivorax and Microbulbifer at petroleum impacted stations. Most identified indicator taxa, notably among macro-fauna, were highly specific to site conditions. Based on our results we suggest that eDNA/eRNA metabarcoding can be used as a stand-alone method for biodiversity assessment or as a complement to morphology-based monitoring approaches.},

Here, we leverage eDNA metabarcoding to characterize nearshore fish communities near Juneau, Alaska, USA, a high-latitude environment with large tidal swings, strong currents, and significant freshwater input. We investigated whether species richness and community composition differed across three habitat types (sand beaches, eel-grass beds, and rocky shorelines) and between high and low tides. Additionally, we tested whether replication of field samples and PCR reactions influenced either species richness or composition. We amplified a 12S mitochondrial locus in our samples and identified 167 fish amplicon sequence variants, which were grouped into 24 unique taxa based on sequence similarity, with approximately half of these taxa resolved to single species. Species richness and composition inferred from eDNA differed substantially among habitats, with rock habitats containing fewer taxa and fewer overall detections than sand and eelgrass habitats. The effect of tide was not significant on its own, but a significant habitat-tide interaction was documented, with the most pronounced differences in taxa between tides found in sand habitats. Power analyses indicated that additional field sampling is useful to detect small changes in species richness such as those due to tide. PCR replicates typically identified few additional taxa. Our results provide important information that can be used to guide future studies, most notably, that the influence of tide on eDNA results appears to be minimal and potentially isolated to certain habitats. This suggests that replication across tides may not be vital for future eDNA studies and that additional replication across space-particularly across heterogeneous environments-likely is a better allocation of sampling effort.

Due to the great intensification of fish farming, the amount of residue deposited into the rearing tanks has increased significantly. Nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) are the main end-products of fish loading, and can affect not only the rearing water, but also the environment as a whole. The output of N and P metabolic wastes by fish was determined by numerous endogenous and exogenous factors such as genetics, life stage, size, rearing system, and diet. Ammonia is predominant type of N excreted, and high levels of ammonia excretion may be due to high protein intake or inadequately formulated diets which provide unbalanced protein synthesis. Phosphorus excretion, usually 69-86\% of dietary P, is associated with the sources of origin, which are used in different ways by different species. The use of phytase in fish feeds is a good alternative which can help to reduce P waste. The diet balance should be standardized and the N and P excretion rates in several rearing systems (mainly the intensive farms) should be measured since a two-to three-fold decrease in the excretion of those pollutants in the fish culture systems could be attained.},

Here we report the human gut microbial composition in a population sample of 123 non-obese and 169 obese Danish individuals. We find two groups of individuals that differ by the number of gut microbial genes and thus gut bacterial richness. They contain known and previously unknown bacterial species at different proportions; individuals with a low bacterial richness (23\% of the population) are characterized by more marked overall adiposity, insulin resistance and dyslipidaemia and a more pronounced inflammatory phenotype when compared with high bacterial richness individuals. The obese individuals among the lower bacterial richness group also gain more weight over time. Only a few bacterial species are sufficient to distinguish between individuals with high and low bacterial richness, and even between lean and obese participants. Our classifications based on variation in the gut microbiome identify subsets of individuals in the general white adult population who may be at increased risk of progressing to adiposity-associated co-morbidities.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT                            Environmental DNA (eDNA) has significant potential to improve the efficiency of biological sampling and detect species that pose challenges for traditional sampling methods. However, a key obstacle in utilizing eDNA data for ecosystem management is uncertainty surrounding the ability to estimate abundance or biomass of multiple species simultaneously. In this study, we use experimental trials with known biomasses of multiple species to explore the feasibility of (1) estimating species proportions from eDNA metabarcoding data and (2) estimating absolute eDNA concentrations of multiple species by scaling metabarcoding proportions with eDNA concentrations of a single species obtained from qPCR. The focal species for this study were three gadid fishes that are key components of marine ecosystems in Alaska and vary in their distribution and habitat use: Walleye pollock (               Gadus chalcogrammus               ), Pacific cod (               Gadus macrocephalus               ), and Arctic cod (               Boreogadus saida               ). After designing gadid‐specific metabarcoding primers and accounting for PCR biases in the metabarcoding data, we found corrected read proportions closely approximated the true biomass proportions of species. Furthermore, we found strong positive relationships between absolute eDNA concentration and absolute biomass for Arctic cod and Pacific cod using quantitative metabarcoding data combined with estimates of Walleye pollock eDNA concentration derived from qPCR. These findings suggest that it is possible to accurately quantify species compositions and estimate metrics of biomass for gadids in real‐world scenarios. Furthermore, this work provides a framework for developing primers and analytical approaches that can be applied to other species to improve the quantitative utility of eDNA.},

We optimized the eDNA method in the laboratory, and applied the optimal eDNA method to survey fish diversity in a natural aquatic life reserve. We simulated necessary steps of the eDNA method in the lab to increase the confidence of the field survey. Specifically, we compared different eDNA sampling, extraction, and sequencing strategies for accurately capturing fish species of the target area. We found that 1L water samples were sufficient for sampling eDNA information of the majority taxa. The filtration was more effective than the centrifugal precipitation for the eDNA extraction. The cloning sequencing was better than the high-throughput sequencing. The field survey showed that the Shannon–Wiener diversity index of fish taxa was the highest in Huairou Reservoir. The diversity index also showed seasonal changes. The accuracy rate of detecting fish taxa was positively correlated with the eDNA concentration. This study provides a scientific reference for an application of the eDNA method in terms of surveying and estimating the biodiversity of aquatic species.},

  abstract = {The Arctic has warmed dramatically in recent decades, with greatest temperature increases observed in the northern Barents Sea. The warming signatures are not constrained to the atmosphere, but extend throughout the water column. Here, using a compilation of hydrographic observations from 1970 to 2016, we investigate the link between changing sea-ice import and this Arctic warming hotspot. A sharp increase in ocean temperature and salinity is apparent from the mid-2000s, which we show can be linked to a recent decline in sea-ice import and a corresponding loss in freshwater, leading to weakened ocean stratification, enhanced vertical mixing and increased upward fluxes of heat and salt that prevent sea-ice formation and increase ocean heat content. Thus, the northern Barents Sea may soon complete the transition from a cold and stratified Arctic to a warm and well-mixed Atlantic-dominated climate regime. Such a shift would have unknown consequences for the Barents Sea ecosystem, including ice-associated marine mammals and commercial fish stocks.},

  abstract = {Climate change drives species distribution shifts, affecting the availability of resources people rely upon for food and livelihoods. These impacts are complex, manifest at local scales, and have diverse effects across multiple species. However, for wild capture fisheries, current understanding is dominated by predictions for individual species at coarse spatial scales. We show that species-specific responses to localized environmental changes will alter the collection of co-occurring species within established fishing footprints along the U.S. West Coast. We demonstrate that availability of the most economically valuable, primary target species is highly likely to decline coastwide in response to warming and reduced oxygen concentrations, while availability of the most abundant, secondary target species will potentially increase. A spatial reshuffling of primary and secondary target species suggests regionally heterogeneous opportunities for fishers to adapt by changing where or what they fish. Developing foresight into the collective responses of species at local scales will enable more effective and tangible adaptation pathways for fishing communities.           ,              Climate change will alter the distribution of harvested marine species, creating substantial challenges for fishers and managers.},

Early detection of invasive mussels and other non‐indigenous species is increasingly needed to prevent their establishment and spread. Environmental DNA (eDNA) techniques potentially offer higher sensitivity monitoring tools to complement more conventional methods for surveying adult and juvenile mussels and veliger larvae. eDNA assays are typically performed on small‐volume (0.5–5\,L) water samples that are concentrated by filtration prior to extraction and downstream processing. Sampling using a towed plankton net of a larger (64\,μm) pore size can process orders of magnitude larger water volumes with the potential for increasing eDNA detection sensitivity. We compared the sensitivities of high‐volume plankton tow net water sampling to filter sampling in three recently infested lakes in Canada and Minnesota, USA. Paired filtration and tow net samples were analyzed for               Dreissena               DNA using an established quantitative polymerase chain reaction assay for the genus. Higher yields of               Dreissena               eDNA (more DNA copies) were recovered from plankton tow than from filtered samples in all 33 paired comparisons. In some cases, plankton tow samples were positive for               Dreissena               eDNA while lower‐volume filtering produced a false negative detection. Our results~demonstrate the effectiveness of plankton tow net sampling for eDNA early detection of invasive mussels, a method that can be used exclusively or as a supplement to filter sampling. Our results further suggest that eDNA testing could be incorporated into monitoring programs that routinely use plankton tows for visual detection of invasive mollusk larvae, as well as other aquatic invasive and non‐invasive species ranging from plankton to metazoans, including many fish.},

However, these and other management goals are elusive when traditional sampling tools (e.g. netting, traps, electrofishing, visual surveys) have poor detection limits, are too slow or are not feasible. One visionary solution is to use an organism's DNA in the environment (eDNA), rather than the organism itself, as the target of detection. In this issue of Molecular Ecology, Thomsen et al. (2012) provide new evidence demonstrating the feasibility of this approach, showing that eDNA is an accurate indicator of the presence of an impressively diverse set of six aquatic or amphibious taxa including invertebrates, amphibians, a fish and a mammal in a wide range of freshwater habitats. They are also the first to demonstrate that the abundance of eDNA, as measured by qPCR, correlates positively with population abundance estimated with traditional tools. Finally, Thomsen et al. (2012) demonstrate that next-generation sequencing of eDNA can quantify species richness. Overall, Thomsen et al. (2012) provide a revolutionary roadmap for using eDNA for detection of species, estimates of relative abundance and quantification of biodiversity. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

  abstract = {Ecosystem-Based Management (EBM) has gained international popularity in recent years, but the lack of consensus on its definition has precluded the use of a universal implementation framework. The large number and variety of principles that make up EBM, and the diversity in perspectives among key management players, has impeded the practical application of EBM. Agreement on a list of the essential ingredients of EBM is vital to successful application. A frequency analysis of EBM principles was conducted to identify the Key Principles that currently define EBM, from a list of twenty-six principles extracted from a subset of the EBM theoretical/conceptual literature (covering a range of published sources across disciplines and application types). Fifteen Key Principles were identified (in descending frequency of appearance in the literature): Consider Ecosystem Connections, Appropriate Spatial \& Temporal Scales, Adaptive Management, Use of Scientific Knowledge, Integrated Management, Stakeholder Involvement, Account for Dynamic Nature of Ecosystems, Ecological Integrity \& Biodiversity, Sustainability, Recognise Coupled Social-Ecological Systems, Decisions reflect Societal Choice, Distinct Boundaries, Interdisciplinarity, Appropriate Monitoring, and Acknowledge Uncertainty. This paper also examines the development of EBM principles over time, leading to predictions on the directions EBM will take in the future. The frequency analysis methodology used here can be replicated to update the Key Principles of EBM in the future. Indeed, further research on potential emerging Key Principles such as 'Consider Cumulative Impacts', 'Apply the Precautionary Approach' and 'Explicitly Acknowledge Trade Offs' will help shape EBM and its successful application in the management of marine activities.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            The accurate extraction of species‐abundance information from DNA‐based data (metabarcoding, metagenomics) could contribute usefully to diet analysis and food‐web reconstruction, the inference of species interactions, the modelling of population dynamics and species distributions, the biomonitoring of environmental state and change, and the inference of false positives and negatives. However, multiple sources of bias and noise in sampling and processing combine to inject error into DNA‐based data sets. To understand how to extract abundance information, it is useful to distinguish two concepts. (i) Within‐sample               across‐species               quantification describes relative species abundances in one sample. (ii) Across‐sample               within‐species               quantification describes how the abundance of each individual species varies from sample to sample, such as over a time series, an environmental gradient or different experimental treatments. First, we review the literature on methods to recover               across‐species               abundance information (by removing what we call “species pipeline biases”) and               within‐species               abundance information (by removing what we call “pipeline noise”). We argue that many ecological questions can be answered with just               within‐species               quantification, and we therefore demonstrate how to use a “DNA spike‐in” to correct for pipeline noise and recover               within‐species               abundance information. We also introduce a model‐based estimator that can be used on data sets without a physical spike‐in to approximate and correct for pipeline noise.},

Each of these arenas of contention has its own history, issues, actors and dynamic; however, each is also distorted by processes of conflict escalation and de-escalation in the other arenas. The intermeshing of domestic insecurities, interstate antagonisms, and global policies create regional 'security complexes' in which the security of each actor is intrinsically linked to the others and cannot realistically be considered apart from one another. Prospects for both the escalation and resolution of the Ethiopia-Eritrea conflict are linked to domestic political processes (such as increasing authoritarianism), regional dynamics (such as local rivalries played out in Somalia) and international policies (such as US counter-terrorism policies).

  abstract = {The construction of a reservoir dam alters the environment within its basin, including composition of the fish community, fish biodiversity, and the river ecosystem itself. This study was conducted in the Sanbanxi Reservoir and used eDNA metabarcoding technology comprising eDNA capture and extraction, PCR amplification, sequencing and database comparison analysis, and other environmental DNA metabarcoding standardized analysis processes to characterize the composition and diversity of fish communities and assess their current status. A total of 48 species of fish were detected. Previously, 68 species of fish were screened and identified in this reservoir based on the reports of Dai and Gu. The results for fish community composition showed that species of the order Cypriniformes are still the most dominant in the Reservoir with 38 species of cyprinids, accounting for 90.81\% of all OTUs. Carp were no longer the dominant species, and Spinibarbus denticulatus, Homalopteridae, Cobitidae, and Sisoridae were not detected, with the exception of Misgurnus anguillicaudatus (Cobitidae). These families have the common characteristic of being adapted to survive in fast-water, sandstone substrate habitats. The results also show that two of the sampling sites, sbx03 and sbx10, significantly differed from other sampling sites due to their geographical environment. The impact of the construction of reservoirs on freshwater fish communities is extreme, since the transformation from a lotic to a lentic habitat contributes to habitat destruction and constrains fish in movement. The change in the aquatic environment before and after the storage of water in the Sanbanxi Reservoir has reduced the number of fish species found in the reservoir, and species characteristically found in fast moving, rapids habitats are virtually absent. The profound change in the aquatic environment from that of a lotic to a lentic habitat leads to changes in the composition of fish populations in the reservoir and to a certain extent a reduction in the ecological stability and species diversity within the reservoir. Therefore, the protection of fish diversity in the reservoir is of great significance to the stability of the ecosystem.},

It differentiates between artificial and locally legitimate hybrid outcomes, and places the ‘hybrid turn’ in the literature in the context of the continued evolution of the liberal peace as it struggles to come to terms with crises of access and legitimacy.},

Samples were collected using experimental trawling, before the establishment of fish cages in the area during early June 1987 and after attaining the maximal production of the aquaculture zone in late May 2001. The overall abundance of the fish assemblage increased by a factor of 4 and the average trophic level of the fish community increased from 3.59 to 3.79. Traditional diversity indices showed an increase in dominance but the distinctness measures of biodiversity showed that the overall structure obtained after the establishment of fish farming was not phylogenetically impoverished. Multivariate analysis showed that the community differences between the two periods are quantitative rather than qualitative. Comparisons in length frequencies between the two periods indicated that specimens of the species compared were either similar or larger in the second period. The species favoured by the presence of aquaculture were not the ones normally feeding on the food pellets under the cages but those normally occurring in the fishing grounds of the study. It is concluded that the release of nutrients from fish farming in nutrient-poor systems can have a positive effect on local fisheries with no visible negative change in species composition or biodiversity. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Three regions of the Aegean Sea with aquaculture zones were sampled in May and September (reproductive and recruitment periods, respectively for most species in the Aegean Sea). In each region, 2 sub-areas were sampled: 1 located nearby the fish farming zones (within 2 to 3 n mile) and a similar site ('reference site') far away from these zones ({$>$}20 n mile). Three replicate hauls were made in each sub-area for each of the 3 investigated regions. Significant differences were observed in community structure between farming and reference sites, which were mainly due to quantitative rather than qualitative aspects. The overall abundance and/or biomass of wild demersal fish was significantly higher near the fish farms in every region studied during May without any significant change in diversity or biodiversity. During the recruitment period in September, total abundance and biomass were fairly similar. These findings support the hypothesis that the presence of fish farms affects the wild fish populations in the oligotrophic eastern Mediterranean at a spatial scale larger than the immediate vicinity of fish cages. It seems that during the recruitment period all sites were stocked with fish close to the carrying capacity of the respective areas, and by late spring the areas close to fish farming zones had suffered little losses during winter, whereas populations at the reference sites had decreased substantially. © Inter-Research 2005.},

  abstract = {Assessing individual components of biodiversity, such as local or regional taxon richness, and differences in community composition is a long-standing challenge in ecology. It is especially relevant in spatially structured and diverse ecosystems. Environmental DNA (eDNA) has been suggested as a novel technique to accurately measure biodiversity. However, we do not yet fully understand the comparability of eDNA-based assessments to previously used approaches. We sampled may-, stone-, and caddisfly genera with contemporary eDNA and kicknet methods at 61 sites distributed over a large river network, allowing a comparison of various diversity measures from the catchment to site levels and providing insights into how these measures relate to network properties. We extended our survey data with historical records of total diversity at the catchment level. At the catchment scale, eDNA and kicknet detected similar proportions of the overall and cumulative historically documented species richness (gamma diversity), namely 42\% and 46\%, respectively. We further found a good overlap (62\%) between the two contemporary methods at the regional scale. At the local scale, we found highly congruent values of local taxon richness (alpha diversity) between eDNA and kicknet. Richness of eDNA was positively related with discharge, a descriptor of network position, while kicknet was not. Beta diversity between sites was similar for the two contemporary methods. Contrary to our expectation, however, beta diversity was driven by species replacement and not by nestedness. Although optimization of eDNA approaches is still needed, our results indicate that this novel technique can capture extensive aspects of gamma diversity, proving its potential utility as a new tool for large sampling campaigns across hitherto understudied complete river catchments, requiring less time and becoming more cost-efficient than classical approaches. Overall, the richness estimated with the two contemporary methods is similar at both local and regional scale but community composition is differently assessed with the two methods at individual sites and becomes more similar with higher discharge.},

  abstract = {Greenland shark Somniosus microcephalus is a potentially important yet poorly studied cold-water species inhabiting the North Atlantic and Arctic Oceans. Broad-scale changes in the Arctic ecosystem as a consequence of climate change have led to increased attention on trophic dynamics and the role of potential apex predators such as S. microcephalus in the structure of Arctic marine food webs. Although Nordic and Inuit populations have caught S. microcephalus for centuries, the species is of limited commercial interest among modern industrial fisheries. Here, the limited historical information available on S. microcephalus occurrence and ecology is reviewed and new catch, biological and life-history information from the Arctic and North Atlantic Ocean region is provided. Given the considerable by-catch rates in high North Atlantic Ocean latitudes it is suggested that S. microcephalus is an abundant predator that plays an important, yet unrecognized, role in Arctic marine ecosystems. Slow growth and large pup sizes, however, may make S. microcephalus vulnerable to increased fishing pressure in a warming Arctic environment. © 2012 Australian Institute of Marine Sciences.

  abstract = {Abstract             In ocean ecosystems, many of the changes in predation risk – both increases and decreases – are human‐induced. These changes are occurring at scales ranging from global to local and across variable temporal scales. Indirect, risk‐based effects of human activity are known to be important in structuring some terrestrial ecosystems, but these impacts have largely been neglected in oceans. Here, we synthesize existing literature and data to explore multiple lines of evidence that collectively suggest diverse human activities are changing marine ecosystems, including carbon storage capacity, in myriad ways by altering predation risk. We provide novel, compelling evidence that at least one key human activity, overfishing, can lead to distinct, cascading risk effects in natural ecosystems whose magnitude exceeds that of presumed lethal effects and may account for previously unexplained findings. We further discuss the conservation implications of human‐caused indirect risk effects. Finally, we provide a predictive framework for when human alterations of risk in oceans should lead to cascading effects and outline a prospectus for future research. Given the speed and extent with which human activities are altering marine risk landscapes, it is crucial that conservation and management policy considers the indirect effects of these activities in order to increase the likelihood of success and avoid unfortunate surprises.},

Hake catchability by the French trawler fleet in the Bay of Biscay: estimating technical and biological components. – ICES Journal of Marine Science, 68: 107–118. Several factors affect trawl catchability: (i) gear and vessel technical characteristics, (ii) anthropogenic factors, and (iii) biological factors. The objectives of this study were to assess the relative contribution of each factor to variations in hake (Merluccius merluccius) landings by the French trawler fleet operating on the shelf of the northern Bay of Biscay (ICES Subdivision VIIIa). Using generalized linear models, the impact of technical and anthropogenic factors was evaluated using landings per unit effort (lpue) obtained from logbooks. Variations in hake lpue were explained primarily by anthropogenic factors. For studying the biological components of catchability, the results of a scientific trawl survey in July 2006 involving three similar trawlers of the French trawler fleet were used. Daytime accessibility to large hake was lower than at night, and about zero for small hake ({$<$}19 cm). Estimates of spatial variation made using generalized linear mixed models showed a patchy fine-scale spatial distribution, but a random larger-scale distribution of hake over the area surveyed.},

Here, we reconstruct catch and demersal community composition in a set of 24 fishing sites in the central Tyrrhenian Sea by gathering environmental DNA (eDNA) aboard commercial bottom‐trawl fishing vessels. We collected genetic material from two sources: the water draining from the net after the end of hauling operations (“slush”), and custom‐made rolls of gauze tied to a hollow perforated sphere placed inside the fishing net (“metaprobe”). Species inventories were generated using a combination of fish‐specific (Tele02 12S) and universal metazoan (COI) molecular markers. DNA metabarcoding data recovered over 90\% of the caught taxa and accurately reconstructed the overall structure of the assemblages of the examined sites, reflecting expected differences linked to major drivers of community structure in Mediterranean demersal ecosystems, such as depth, distance from the coast, and fishing effort. eDNA also returned a “biodiversity bonus” mostly consisting of pelagic species not catchable by bottom trawl but present in the surrounding environment. Overall, the “metaprobe” gauzes showed a greater biodiversity detection power as compared to “slush” water, both qualitatively and quantitatively, strengthening the idea that these low‐cost sampling devices can play a major role in upscaling the gathering of data on both catch composition and the broader ecological characteristics of marine communities sustaining trawling activities. This approach has the potential to drastically expand the reach of ecological monitoring, whereby fishing vessels operating across the oceans may serve as opportunistic scientific platforms to increase the strength and granularity of marine biodiversity data.},

In trying to circumvent the many challenges associated with water filtration and DNA isolation from environmental samples, significant investment is being made in high-tech solutions, such as automated underwater vehicles and robots [2]. Here, instead, we explored a simpler, alternative option, based on the recovery of eDNA from sponges (phylum Porifera), the planet's most effective water-filterers. We obtained sponge samples from Mediterranean and Antarctic surveys, extracted total DNA from their tissues, and obtained tens of thousands of fish DNA reads via metabarcoding, which were able to clearly distinguish samples from the two regions. One Antarctic sample yielded hundreds of reads from chinstrap penguin (Pygoscelis antarcticus) and Weddell seal (Leptonychotes weddellii). We argue that this ‘natural sampler DNA’ (nsDNA) approach is poised to become a powerful, affordable, universal tool for aquatic biodiversity monitoring globally. Mariani et al. show that marine sponges are natural samplers of environmental DNA.}

  abstract = {Abstract                            Spatial and temporal monitoring of species threatened with extinction is of critical importance for conservation and ecosystem management. In the Mediterranean coast, the fan mussel (               Pinna nobilis               ) is listed as critically endangered after suffering from a mass mortality event since 2016, leading to 100\% mortality in most marine populations. Conventional monitoring for this macroinvertebrate is done using scuba, which is challenging in dense meadows or with low visibility. Here we developed an environmental DNA assay targeting the fan mussel and assessed the influence of several environmental parameters on the species detectability in~situ. We developed and tested an eDNA molecular marker and collected 48 water samples in two sites at the Thau lagoon (France) with distinct fan mussel density, depths and during two seasons (summer and autumn). Our marker can amplify fan mussel DNA but lacks specificity since it also amplifies a conspecific species (               Pinna rudis               ). We successfully amplified fan mussel DNA from in~situ samples with 46 positive samples (out of 48) using ddPCR, although the DNA concentrations measured were low over almost all samples. Deeper sampling depth slightly increased DNA concentrations, but no seasonal effect was found. We highlight a putative spawning event on a single summer day with much higher DNA concentration compared to all other samples. We present an eDNA molecular assay able to detect the endangered fan mussel and provide guidelines to optimize the sampling protocol to maximize detectability. Effective and non‐invasive monitoring tools for endangered species are promising to monitor remaining populations and have the potential of ecological restoration or habitat recolonization following a mass mortality event.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Environmental DNA (eDNA) analysis has advanced conservation biology and biodiversity management. However, accurate estimation of age and origin of eDNA is complicated by particle transport and the presence of legacy genetic material, which can obscure accurate interpretation of eDNA detection and quantification. To understand the state of genomic material within the environment, we investigated the degradation relationships between (a) size of fragments (long vs short), (b) genomic origins (mitochondrial vs nuclear), (c) nucleic acids (eDNA vs eRNA), and (d) RNA types (messenger (m)RNA vs ribosomal (r)RNA) from non-indigenous               Dreissena               mussels. Initial concentrations of eRNA followed expected transcriptional trends, with rRNAs found at\,{$>$}\,1000\,×\,that of eDNA, and a mitosis-associated mRNA falling below detection limits within 24~h. Furthermore, the ratio of eRNA:eDNA significantly decreased throughout degradation, potentially providing an estimate for the age of genomic material. Thus, eRNA quantification can increase detection due to the high concentrations of rRNAs. Furthermore, it may improve interpretation of positive detections through the eRNA:eDNA ratio and/or by detecting low abundant mitosis-associated mRNAs that degrade within\,\textasciitilde\,24~h.},

However, criticisms have arisen around aquaculture, most of them related to the destruction of ecosystems such as mangrove forest to construct aquaculture farms, as well as the environmental impacts of the effluents on the receiving ecosystems. The inherent benefits of aquaculture such as massive food production and economical profits have led the scientific community to seek for diverse strategies to minimize the negative impacts, rather than just prohibiting the activity. Aquaculture is a possible panacea, but at present is also responsible for diverse problems related with the environmental health; however the new strategies proposed during the last decade have proven that it is possible to achieve a sustainable aquaculture, but such strategies should be supported and proclaimed by the different federal environmental agencies from all countries. Additionally there is an urgent need to improve legislation and regulation for aquaculture. Only under such scenario, aquaculture will be a sustainable practice. © 2012 Marcel Martinez-Porchas and Luis R. Martinez-Cordova.},

  abstract = {Increasing speed and magnitude of global change threaten the world's biodiversity and particularly coral reef fishes. A better understanding of large-scale patterns and processes on coral reefs is essential to prevent fish biodiversity decline but it requires new monitoring approaches. Here, we use environmental DNA metabarcoding to reconstruct well-known patterns of fish biodiversity on coral reefs and uncover hidden patterns on these highly diverse and threatened ecosystems. We analysed 226 environmental DNA (eDNA) seawater samples from 100 stations in five tropical regions (Caribbean, Central and Southwest Pacific, Coral Triangle and Western Indian Ocean) and compared those to 2047 underwater visual censuses from the Reef Life Survey in 1224 stations. Environmental DNA reveals a higher (16\%) fish biodiversity, with 2650 taxa, and 25\% more families than underwater visual surveys. By identifying more pelagic, reef-associated and crypto-benthic species, eDNA offers a fresh view on assembly rules across spatial scales. Nevertheless, the reef life survey identified more species than eDNA in 47 shared families, which can be due to incomplete sequence assignment, possibly combined with incomplete detection in the environment, for some species. Combining eDNA metabarcoding and extensive visual census offers novel insights on the spatial organization of the richest marine ecosystems.},

In contrast to previous theories of dense-water formation by deep convection in the Iceland and Greenland Seas, an alternative circulation scheme is presented in which the Atlantic Water in the northward flowing Norwegian Atlantic Current becomes gradually more dense by heat loss to the atmosphere and in which the dense water is transported to the outflow regions along the boundary currents surrounding the Iceland and Greenland Seas at shallow and intermediate depths. The overall circulation in the Nordic Seas that is consistent with these data is described. The cyclonic flow, fed by the Norwegian Atlantic Current, consists of three distinct branches: flow westward in the Fram Strait; flow northward through the Fram Strait and then through the Arctic Ocean; and flow passing through the Barents Sea and then through the Arctic Ocean. The branches, with modified hydrographic properties, return southwards as distinct layers of the East Greenland Current, the former two to supply the Denmark Strait overflow, the latter to supply the Iceland Scotland overflow. The principal water mass product of the Iceland and Greenland Seas is an intermediate water mass that supplies the Iceland Scotland overflow.},

Considered extinct in the UK,               I. nubecula               was recently rediscovered (in one location of the River Dee, Wales), after 22 years of absence. In a similar way to many other species of Perlodidae,               I. nubecula               could be utilised as a bio-indicator, for assessing water quality and health status of a given freshwater system. However, conventional monitoring of invertebrates via kick-sampling, is invasive and expensive (time consuming). Further, such methods require a high level of taxonomic expertise. Here, we compared the traditional kick-sampling method with the use of eDNA detection using qPCR and ddPCR-analyses. In spring 2018, we sampled eDNA from twelve locations on the River Dee.               I. nubecula               was detected using kick-sampling in five of these locations, three locations using both eDNA detection and kick-sampling and one location using eDNA detection alone – resulting in a total of six known and distinct populations of this critically endangered species. Interestingly, despite the eDNA assay being validated               in vitro               and               in silico               , and results indicating high sensitivity, qPCR analysis of the eDNA samples proved to be ineffective. In contrast, ddPCR analyses resulted in a clear detection of               I. nubecula               at four locations suggesting that inhibition most likely explains the large discrepancy between the obtained qPCR and ddPCR results. It is therefore important to explore inhibition effects on any new eDNA assay. We also highlight that ddPCR may well be the best option for the detection of aquatic organisms which are either rare or likely to shed low levels of eDNA into their environment.},

  abstract = {Science-based management of marine fisheries and effective ecosystem monitoring both require the analysis of large amounts of often complex and difficult to collect information. Legislation also increasingly requires the attainment of good environmental status, which again demands collection of data to enable efficient monitoring and management of biodiversity. Such data is traditionally obtained as a result of research surveys through the capture and/or visual identification of organisms. Recent years have seen significant advances in the utilisation of environmental DNA (eDNA) in the marine environment in order to develop alternative cost-effective ways to gather relevant data. Such approaches attempt to identify and/or quantify the species present at a location through the detection of extra-organismal DNA in the environment. These new eDNA based approaches have the potential to revolutionise data collection in the marine environment using non-invasive sampling methods and providing snapshots of biodiversity beyond the capacity of traditional sampling. Here we present a non-technical summary of different approaches in the field of eDNA, and emphasise the broad application of this approach, with value for the governance and management of marine aquatic ecosystems. The review focuses on identifying those tools which are now readily applicable and those which show promise but are currently in development and require further validations. The aim is to provide an understanding of techniques and concepts that can be used by managers without genetic or genomic expertise when consulting with specialists to perform joint evaluations of the utility of the approaches.},

Despite extensive research in qPCR laboratory protocols, normalization and statistical analysis, little attention has been given to qPCR non-detects—those reactions failing to produce a minimum amount of signal.             Results: We show that the common methods of handling qPCR non-detects lead to biased inference. Furthermore, we show that non-detects do not represent data missing completely at random and likely represent missing data occurring not at random. We propose a model of the missing data mechanism and develop a method to directly model non-detects as missing data. Finally, we show that our approach results in a sizeable reduction in bias when estimating both absolute and differential gene expression.             Availability and implementation: The proposed algorithm is implemented in the R package, nondetects. This package also contains the raw data for the three example datasets used in this manuscript.

Though humans have caused few global marine extinctions, we have profoundly affected marine wildlife, altering the functioning and provisioning of services in every ocean. Current ocean trends, coupled with terrestrial defaunation lessons, suggest that marine defaunation rates will rapidly intensify as human use of the oceans industrializes.

  abstract = {"Trends in invasive alien species" is one of only two indicators of threat to biodiversity that form part of the Convention on Biological Diversity's (CBD) framework for monitoring progress toward its "2010 target" (i.e., the commitment to achieve by 2010 a significant reduction in the current rate of biodiversity loss). To date, however, there is no fully developed indicator for invasive alien species (IAS) that combines trends, derived from a standard set of methods, across species groups, ecosystems, and regions. Here we provide a rationale for the form and characteristics of an indicator of trends in IAS that will meet the 2010 framework goal and targets for this indicator. We suggest single and composite indicators that include problem-status and management-status measures that are designed to be flexible, readily disaggregated, and as far as possible draw on existing data. The single indicators at national and global scales are number of IAS and numbers of operational management plans for IAS. Global trends in IAS are measured as the progress of nations toward the targets of stabilizing IAS numbers and the implementation of IAS management plans. The proposed global indicator thus represents a minimum information set that most directly addresses the indicator objective and simultaneously aims to maximize national participation. This global indicator now requires testing to assess its accuracy, sensitivity, and tractability. Although it may not be possible to achieve the desired objective for a global indicator of biological invasion by 2010 as comprehensively as desired, it seems possible to obtain trend estimates for a component of the taxa, ecosystems, and regions involved. Importantly, current indicator development initiatives will also contribute to developing the mechanisms necessary for monitoring global trends in IAS beyond 2010. © 2006 Society for Conservation Biology.},

But the measurements they provide differ from the truth, often dramatically, because these experiments are biased toward detecting some taxa over others. This experimental bias makes the taxon or gene abundances measured by different protocols quantitatively incomparable and can lead to spurious biological conclusions. We propose a mathematical model for how bias distorts community measurements based on the properties of real experiments. We validate this model with 16S rRNA gene and shotgun metagenomics data from defined bacterial communities. Our model better fits the experimental data despite being simpler than previous models. We illustrate how our model can be used to evaluate protocols, to understand the effect of bias on downstream statistical analyses, and to measure and correct bias given suitable calibration controls. These results illuminate new avenues toward truly quantitative and reproducible metagenomics measurements.},

  abstract = {Although some lineages of animals and plants have made impressive adaptive radiations when provided with ecological opportunity, the propensities to radiate vary profoundly among lineages for unknown reasons. In Africa’s Lake Victoria region, one cichlid lineage radiated in every lake, with the largest radiation taking place in a lake less than 16,000 years old. We show that all of its ecological guilds evolved in situ. Cycles of lineage fusion through admixture and lineage fission through speciation characterize the history of the radiation. It was jump-started when several swamp-dwelling refugial populations, each of which were of older hybrid descent, met in the newly forming lake, where they fused into a single population, resuspending old admixture variation. Each population contributed a different set of ancient alleles from which a new adaptive radiation assembled in record time, involving additional fusion-fission cycles. We argue that repeated fusion-fission cycles in the history of a lineage make adaptive radiation fast and predictable.           ,              Editor’s summary                            Adaptive radiation produces a great deal of diversity during the process of evolution, but not all lineages radiate, and in fact, most don’t. For decades, researchers have been interested in why radiations occur and many studies have looked at this using the striking radiation of African rift lake cichlids. Meier               et al               . studied the radiations within Lake Victoria and confirmed that the radiation in this lake, covering many trophic guilds, occurred only 16,000 years ago. Furthermore, they found that the radiation was able to occur so rapidly because of a repeating process of hybridization and specialization. —Sacha Vignieri                        ,              Lake Victoria cichlids radiated into multiple specialized lineages in just 16,000 years through cycles of lineage “fusion” and “fission.”           ,                             INTRODUCTION               Much of species diversity is thought to have arisen during adaptive radiations—the process whereby many species arise in short succession and diversify in their ecological niche use. It is not understood why, when given ecological opportunity, some lineages readily undergo adaptive radiations, whereas others do not. A lineage with exceptional propensity to radiate is that of the cichlid fishes of the Lake Victoria region. In this instance, each major lake harbors highly ecologically diverse cichlid assemblages, ranging from algivores to zooplanktivores to predators that feed on other members of the radiation. We had previously shown that all of these radiations evolved from a hybrid population between two lineages that merged about 150,000 years ago.                                         RATIONALE               In the Pleistocene dry period, {$>$}20,000 to \textasciitilde 16,000 years ago, Lake Victoria was completely dry, and any previous radiation would have died out. The deeper Western Rift Lakes Edward, Kivu, and Albert may still have hosted parts of their cichlid radiations. It thus remained unclear whether the ecological guilds had colonized Lake Victoria from these deeper lakes or whether they evolved in a new adaptive radiation. In this work, we test whether the hundreds of ecologically diverse Lake Victoria cichlids in fact diverged from a common ancestor in less than 16,000 years and how they diversified so rapidly.                                         RESULTS               We generated a whole-genome dataset of 464 cichlids representing all major lakes in the region and several species of almost all the ecological groups in Lake Victoria. We find that the Lake Victoria cichlids evolved in the lake as an extremely rapid adaptive radiation. The process started from hybrid ancestry of at least three lineages that must have survived the dry period in swamps in the region. We find evidence that each of these parental lineages contributed ecologically relevant alleles that facilitated the rapid radiation in Lake Victoria. Hybridization between members of the emerging Lake Victoria Radiation additionally gave rise to yet more guilds and species. Cycles of hybridization leading to the fusion of lineages followed by diversification (lineage fission) thus occurred repeatedly throughout the evolutionary history. As shown previously, the hybridization event about 150,000 years ago facilitated the older radiations in the region, and in this work, we show that further cycles of fusion and fission allowed the lineage to retain large, phenotypically relevant genetic variation and thus to radiate extremely rapidly.                                         CONCLUSION               Multiple cycles of lineage fusion and fission likely explain the very high propensity of these cichlids to form parallel adaptive radiations across multiple trophic levels. It may be generally true that animal or plant lineages that have recently radiated are not only particularly prone to hybridize but are also prone to radiate again from the resulting hybrid populations, perpetuating and exacerbating the differences in diversification rates between lineages. The variation in radiation propensity is thus not a property of any one species but that of an evolving flock of species. This finding also suggests that we should grow beyond species-centric conservation strategies and aim to preserve entire species complexes to preserve their capacity to adapt and diversify.                                                   Multiple cycles of lineage fusion by hybridization and diversification led to increasingly rapid and extensive radiations of cichlid fishes, including the explosive evolution of 500 Lake Victoria species across four trophic levels in 16,000 years.                   The blue lines reflect lineage fusion and fission events inferred in this work. The fish photos visualize some ecological groups that evolved in parallel in each lake, making up entire trophic networks.

  abstract = {Significance             Prokaryotes dominate the living biomass and the biological diversity of the ocean, one of the largest ecosystems on earth. The sinking of particles is a widespread mechanism that transports materials to the deep ocean, with a significant role in the global carbon cycle. Whether this process constitutes a global dispersal pathway for prokaryotic diversity connecting surface communities to those in the dark ocean has never been tested. Here we show that surface and deep-sea prokaryotic communities are strongly connected, constituting a vast oceanic metacommunity where local assemblages are linked through the transport of sinking particles. This vertical dispersal, mediated mainly by the largest sinking particles, emerges as a fundamental process shaping the assembly and biogeography of deep ocean prokaryotic communities.           ,              The sinking of organic particles formed in the photic layer is a main vector of carbon export into the deep ocean. Although sinking particles are heavily colonized by microbes, so far it has not been explored whether this process plays a role in transferring prokaryotic diversity from surface to deep oceanic layers. Using Illumina sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene, we explore here the vertical connectivity of the ocean microbiome by characterizing marine prokaryotic communities associated with five different size fractions and examining their compositional variability from surface down to 4,000 m across eight stations sampled in the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans during the Malaspina 2010 Expedition. Our results show that the most abundant prokaryotes in the deep ocean are also present in surface waters. This vertical community connectivity seems to occur predominantly through the largest particles because communities in the largest size fractions showed the highest taxonomic similarity throughout the water column, whereas free-living communities were more isolated vertically. Our results further suggest that particle colonization processes occurring in surface waters determine to some extent the composition and biogeography of bathypelagic communities. Overall, we postulate that sinking particles function as vectors that inoculate viable particle-attached surface microbes into the deep-sea realm, determining to a considerable extent the structure, functioning, and biogeography of deep ocean communities.},

  abstract = {The Northeast Arctic cod (Gadus morhua L.: NEAC) remains the most abundant cod stock in the North Atlantic, while the catches of the partially co-occurring Norwegian coastal cod (NCC) stocks have dramatically decreased in recent years. To ensure effective management of the two stocks, it is necessary to know if the population genetic structure is associated with any pattern in the spatial dynamics or whether it is affected by any distinct environmental factors. By combining information from electronic data storage tags (DST)and molecular genetics methods with statistical tools, we have been able to associate spatial dynamics and distinct environmental factors to the two cod stocks. In general, adult NEAC migrate between deep, warm overwintering grounds and shallow summer feeding grounds where water temperatures maybe low. In contrast, NCC do not undertake large-scale seasonal migrations, show little seasonal variation in depth distribution, and experience the opposite seasonal change in temperature compared with NEAC. However, within the NCC group, some individuals did conduct longer horizontal movements than others. Even though the distances calculated in this study represent the shortest distance between release and recapture positions, they are far higher than previously reported by NCC. Distinctive depth profiles indicate that this migrant NCC have moved out of the area, passing the deep trenches outside Lofoten while more stationary NCC occupies shallower depths throughout the year. The temperature profiles also indicate that migrant and stationary NCC has occupied different areas during the year. We demonstrate that the combination of information from DSTs and molecular genetics offers a deeper understanding of individual cod behaviour, provides an insight in the spatial dynamics of the species, and ultimately, improves the scientific basis for management of a complex mixed fishery of Atlantic cod.},

  abstract = {Since 1987, the use of antibacterial drugs in Norwegian fish farming has been drastically reduced from about 48tonnes to approximately 1tonne annually, varying slightly from year to year. The 649kg active substance prescribed in 2007 corresponds to approximately 0.03\% of the produced biomass being treated once with an antibacterial drug. This is an exceptional figure, particularly when compared with antibacterial drug use in terrestrial animal production or humans. It is therefore highly unlikely that this limited use of antibacterial drugs in farmed fish poses a significant risk to human medicine via the development of antibacterial drug resistance. Among the factors contributing to this favourable situation are: (a) a unique government-industry initiative adopted in the early 1990s to facilitate vaccination against classical furunculosis; (b) development of high-quality vaccines by the pharmaceutical industry; © the continuing predominance of vaccination strategies for disease control among fish farmers; (d) adoption of 'all-in-all-out' production systems, with mandatory fallowing periods between year classes; and (e) zoning and the spatial re-arrangement of marine production sites to minimize horizontal spread of infections. In Norway, targeted and flexible governance has allowed the rapid implementation of mass vaccination as well as zoo-sanitary measures. The limited use, however, also tends to limit the availability of licensed veterinary drugs in the marketplace. This creates a dilemma that should be addressed as a strategic issue for further long-term development of sustainable industrialized aquaculture. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

Segregating natural from anthropogenically induced change in marine ecosystems requires long-term, sustained observations of marine biota.

Application of the methodology to studies using subsampled catch data and to towed gears having windows or grids is outlined, and examples applied to passive nets and towed gears are presented. The analysis of data from replicate deployments is covered in detail, with particular regard to modelling the fixed and random effects of between-haul variation. Recent developments on the design of selectivity experiments are introduced and demonstrated.},

  abstract = {The objectives of this study were as follows: (1) estimate the mortality of striped bass and American shad associated with catch and release practices commonly occurring in the spring recreational fisheries in the Hudson River, and (2) assess the influence of selected variables, e.g. water temperature, playing and handling time, hook location, degree of bleeding, and length, on hooking mortality rates. These results provide fishery managers with information necessary to determine the contribution of hook and release mortality to the overall fishing mortality rate in the Hudson River striped bass and American shad fisheries. The results may be useful in developing guidelines for reducing mortalities of released fish and the possible development of regulations designed to control mortality rates associated with recreational fishing.}

  abstract = {The framing of issues of migration and clandestine travel in the European Union are tied up with a historically-specific ethos towards the outsider, which, after philosopher Jacques Rancière, I term a "count" The count shaping the interventions of contemporary advocacy and humanitarian groups derives from conceptions of ethics rooted in political modernity, and - for Rancière - are also responsible for foreclosing disruptive appearances of equality. In practice, postures of compassion towards the refugee convert expressions of vocal dissent into matters for moral sympathy. In this paper I explore the implications of this claim for a future politics of asylum, focussing on moments of interruption to an underlying count. I suggest that the staging of the situation of undocumented migrants in Calais through the figure of the migrant rather than the refugee demonstrates a recasting of activism as a form of political listening rather than political speech - in this sense the interventions of anarchistic network No Borders reflect a call for a continuous "recount" of the situation, over an affirmation of a particular framing of the situation. In some ways this call remains problematic, sometimes reframing the voices of local people and migrants according to an external vision of politics. Nevertheless, I hold that this denaturalisation of compassionate hospitality as the only ethical response to asylum is useful in the broader terrain of political dissent, and points to the importance of embodied habit as a locus for enduring social transformations. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract = {Sustained observations of marine biodiversity and ecosystems focused on specific conservation and management problems are needed around the world to effectively mitigate or manage changes resulting from anthropogenic pressures. These observations, while complex and expensive, are required by the international scientific, governance and policy communities to provide baselines against which the effects of human pressures and climate change may be measured and reported, and resources allocated to implement solutions. To identify biological and ecological essential ocean variables (EOVs) for implementation within a global ocean observing system that is relevant for science, informs society, and technologically feasible, we used a driver-pressure-state-impact-response (DPSIR) model. We (1) examined relevant international agreements to identify societal drivers and pressures on marine resources and ecosystems, (2) evaluated the temporal and spatial scales of variables measured by 100+ observing programs, and (3) analysed the impact and scalability of these variables and how they contribute to address societal and scientific issues. EOVs were related to the status of ecosystem components (phytoplankton and zooplankton biomass and diversity, and abundance and distribution of fish, marine turtles, birds and mammals), and to the extent and health of ecosystems (cover and composition of hard coral, seagrass, mangrove and macroalgal canopy). Benthic invertebrate abundance and distribution and microbe diversity and biomass were identified as emerging EOVs to be developed based on emerging requirements and new technologies. The temporal scale at which any shifts in biological systems will be detected will vary across the EOVs, the properties being monitored and the length of the existing time-series. Global implementation to deliver useful products will require collaboration of the scientific and policy sectors and a significant commitment to improve human and infrastructure capacity across the globe, including the development of new, more automated observing technologies, and encouraging the application of international standards and best practices.},

This method has mostly been applied to biodiversity monitoring using environmental DNA (eDNA) shed from fish and, coupled with next-generation sequencing technologies, has enabled massively parallel sequencing of several hundred eDNA samples simultaneously. Since the publication of its technical outline in 2015, this method has been widely used in various aquatic environments in and around the six continents, and MiFish primers have demonstrably outperformed other competing primers. Here, we outline the technical progress in this method over the last 5~years and highlight some case studies on marine, freshwater, and estuarine fish communities. Additionally, we discuss various applications of MiFish metabarcoding to non-fish organisms, single-species detection systems, quantitative biodiversity monitoring, and bulk DNA samples other than eDNA. By recognizing the MiFish eDNA metabarcoding strengths and limitations, we argue that this method is useful for ecosystem conservation strategies and the sustainable use of fishery resources in “ecosystem-based fishery management” through continuous biodiversity monitoring at multiple sites.},

The health of wild salmon stocks critically concerns Indigenous peoples, commercial and recreational fishers, and the general public. Despite potential impact of viral pathogens such as Piscine orthoreovirus-1 (PRV-1) on endangered wild salmon populations, their epidemiology in wild fish populations remains obscure, as does the role of aquaculture in global and local spread. Our phylogeographic analyses of PRV-1 suggest that development of Atlantic salmon aquaculture facilitated spread from Europe to the North and South East Pacific. Phylogenetic analysis and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction surveillance further illuminate the circumstances of emergence of PRV-1 in the North East Pacific and provide strong evidence for Atlantic salmon aquaculture as a source of infection in wild Pacific salmon. PRV-1 is now an important infectious agent in critically endangered wild Pacific salmon populations, fueled by aquacultural transmission.},

We measured the quantity and degradation of eDNA over a two month period across a range of filters differing in pore size (0, 0.2, 1 and 10 µm), which spans the range of eDNA source material including subcellular, cellular and tissue. We also used two primer sets targeting mitochondrial (COI) and nuclear (18S) genomic regions. Our findings demonstrated that eDNA was most prevalent in the effluent water, but also reliably detected on the 0.2 μm filter, suggesting subcellular material is the predominate state of eDNA. Temporal eDNA quantity dynamics followed an exponential decay function over the course of 6-17 days, demonstrating a predictable decline in eDNA concentration. Nuclear eDNA was more abundant than mitochondrial eDNA, which may be a result of greater primer affinity, or indicate greater availability of nuclear eDNA gene targets in the environment. In contrast to two previous size-sorting experiments, which utilizing fish eDNA, our findings suggest that the state of invertebrate eDNA is much smaller than previously suspected. Overall, our data suggest that the detection of eDNA greatly depends on our knowledge of the state and fate of eDNA, which differ among species, and likely across environmental conditions.},

  abstract = {Environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding has the potential to revolutionize conservation planning by providing spatially and taxonomically comprehensive data on biodiversity and ecosystem conditions, but its utility to inform the design of protected areas remains untested. Here, we quantify whether and how identifying conservation priority areas within coral reef ecosystems differs when biodiversity information is collected via eDNA analyses or traditional visual census records. We focus on 147 coral reefs in Indonesia’s hyper-diverse Wallacea region and show large discrepancies in the allocation and spatial design of conservation priority areas when coral reef species were surveyed with underwater visual techniques (fishes, corals, and algae) or eDNA metabarcoding (eukaryotes and metazoans). Specifically, incidental protection occurred for 55\% of eDNA species when targets were set for species detected by visual surveys and 71\% vice versa. This finding is supported by generally low overlap in detection between visual census and eDNA methods at species level, with more overlap at higher taxonomic ranks. Incomplete taxonomic reference databases for the highly diverse Wallacea reefs, and the complementary detection of species by the two methods, underscore the current need to combine different biodiversity data sources to maximize species representation in conservation planning.},

They are useful for tracking ontogenetic shifts in the host’s diet, the occurrence of specific organisms or migratory behaviour of their hosts, even in inaccessible environments. In the present study, stomach content analyses and parasitological examinations were performed on 70 Atlantic cod Gadus morhua, one of the most important high-level predators of small fish in the North Atlantic, caught during one research vessel cruise from West and East Greenlandic waters. Analyses revealed significant differences in fish size with higher values for East Greenland (average total length (TL) of 50.5 cm) compared to West Greenland (average TL of 33.3 cm). Clear differences were also present in prey and parasite composition. Crustacea was the main food source for all fish (IRI = 10082.70), while the importance of teleosts increased with fish size. With a prevalence of 85 \% in West Greenland and 100 \% in East Greenland, Nematoda were the most abundant parasite group. The results indicate an ontogenetic shift in the diet, which are discussed in the context of the common distribution theory, stock dynamics and migratory behaviour.},

This study aimed to reveal the dispersion and degradation processes of eDNA in the sea. Caged fish were set off the end of a pier in Maizuru Bay, the Sea of Japan, and their eDNA was traced at sampling stations located at the cage and 10, 30, 100, 300, 600 and 1000~m distances from the cage along two transect lines. Sea surface water was collected at each station at 0, 2, 4, 8, 24 and 48~h after setting the cage, and again after removing the cage. Quantitative PCR analyses using a species-specific primer and probe set revealed that the target DNA was detectable while the cage was present and for up to 1~h after removing the cage, but not at 2~h or later. Among the 57 amplified samples, 45 (79\%) were collected within 30~m from the cage. These results suggest that eDNA can provide a snapshot of organisms present in a coastal marine environment.}

The northern region of the North Sea (56–62°N) was sampled in February/March 2009 for eggs and in May 2010 for larvae. To aid in the identification of Norway pout stage I eggs and distinguish them from other ‘cod-like’ eggs, a Taq-Man probe was designed for this species and used here. Stage I Norway pout egg diameters collected from the field were in the range 1.03–1.28 mm and largely overlapped with the size range determined for whiting (Merlangius merlangus). The distribution of Norway pout stage I eggs in 2009 revealed the distribution of spawning in the North Sea and showed that it was similar to the distribution of 2 + Norway pout taken during the International Bottom Trawl Surveys (IBTS) over the same period covering the whole North Sea. The larvae sampled in 2010 were largely in the same area; however, larger larvae occurred to the south-east of the survey area, suggesting advection of young stages from the principal spawning areas in the north-western North Sea to the south-east and toward the Skagerrak.},

We show that risks of damage to wild salmon populations, ecosystems, and society are large when salmon are farmed in their native range, when large numbers of salmon are farmed relative to the size of wild populations, and when exotic pathogens are introduced. We then evaluate the policy and management options for reducing risks and discuss the implications for farming other types of marine finfish.},

In 2007 and 2008, 21 reaches were sampled on 16 nonwadeable rivers throughout Iowa; reaches were 3 or 5 km in length, depending on stream order. A total of 21,197 fish from 83 species were sampled in this study. Electrofishing produced the highest number of species (65), followed by trawling (60) and seining (54). Forty‐seven percent of all the species sampled in this study were captured by all three gears. Four species were captured only by the seine, 8 only by the trawl, and 13 only by electrofishing. Fish sampling data were used to evaluate gears and estimate the number of samples required to observe specified percentages of the total number of species in each reach. The minimum effort necessary to sample 90\% of the species in a reach with 95\% confidence was determined using a resampling procedure. Sampling with a seine was considered ineffective in nonwadeable rivers and did not substantially reduce the effort necessary to sample 90\% of the species in a reach. In 3‐km‐long reaches, the minimum effort necessary to sample 90\% of the species observed was fifteen 100‐m electrofishing runs and twenty‐four 50‐m‐long trawls. Twenty‐five 100‐m electrofishing runs and forty‐two 50‐m‐long trawls were necessary to sample 90\% of the species observed in 5‐km‐long reaches.

Laboratory tests showed submillimetre accuracy in length measurements of 50.8 mm targets at close range, with increasing errors (mostly {$<$}1\%) at longer range and for longer targets. A field test on juvenile Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) feeding behavior in Alaska streams found that individuals within aggregations avoided the immediate proximity of their competitors, out to a distance of 1.0 to 2.9 body lengths. This system makes 3D video measurement a practical tool for laboratory and field studies of aquatic or terrestrial animal behavior and ecology.},

Greenland sharks have previously been considered scavengers, but recent studies suggest that Greenland sharks also predate on live prey. In this study, distribution and feeding ecology in Greenland waters were investigated. Based on data from 25 years of surveys, Greenland sharks were usually caught at 400-700 m but were found at all depths between 100 and 1,200 m. Based on examination of stomachs from 30 Greenland sharks (total length of 258-460 cm), the most important prey items were Atlantic cod (65.6 \% IRI), harp seal (9.9 \% IRI), skates (5.2 \% IRI) and wolffish (4.4 \% IRI), but large geographical variations were observed. Prey composition and qualitative observations support the hypothesis of active predation. Consistent with other studies, the results of this work support the notion that the Greenland shark is an apex predator with the potential to influence trophic dynamics in the Arctic. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

Discrimination was made between pelagic and benthic carbon sources, where feeding in most cases reflected the habitat. Trophic levels from these analyses, TL               N               , were compared with corresponding levels estimated by an Ecopath mass-balance model, TL               E               , constructed independently of the isotope data. The good correlation between the two methods (r               2               = 0.72) supports the diet composition and the grouping of taxa into ecological groups in the model. However, when estimates diverged, this was often explained by the analyses of few taxa, taxa that were not the most representative for the group, or the analyses of specimens from a limited size range. Some assumed detrivores were assigned high TL               N               in favour of an abundant microbial community in the sediments.

We therefore evaluated the sequence variant tools DADA2, Deblur, Swarm, and UNOISE, using high-diversity seafloor samples, resulting in comparisons of 1800 sequence variant tables. The evaluation was based on 30 sediment grab samples, for which 3 replica samples were collected. Each replica sample was extracted using 5 common DNA extraction kits, resulting in 450 DNA extracts which were 16S rRNA gene sequenced (V3–V4), using Illumina. Assessments included variation across replica samples, extraction kits, and denoising methods, in addition to applying prior knowledge about alpha diversity correlations toward the cosmopolitan marine archaeon Nitrosopumilus with high diversity and the sulfide oxidizing Sulfurovum with low diversity. DADA2 displayed the highest variance between replicates (Manhattan distance 1.14), while Swarm showed the lowest variance (Manhattan distance 0.93). For the analysis based on prior biological knowledge, UNOISE displayed the highest alpha diversity (Simpson’s D) correlation toward Nitrosopumilus (Spearman rho\,=\,0.85), while DADA2 showed the lowest (Spearman rho\,=\,0.10). Deblur completely eliminated Nitrosopumilus from the dataset. For Sulfurovum, on the other hand, all the methods showed comparable results. In conclusion, our evaluations show that Swarm and UNOISE performed better than DADA2 and Deblur for high-diversity seafloor samples.},

To realise this potential, DNA-derived occurrence data (notably sequences with dates and coordinates) – much like traditional specimens and observations – need to be discoverable and interpretable through biodiversity data platforms. The Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) recently headed a community effort to assemble a set of guidelines for publishing DNA-derived data. These guidelines target the principles and approaches of exposing DNA-derived occurrence data in the context of broader biodiversity data. They cover a choice of terms using a controlled vocabulary, common pitfalls, and good practices, without going into platform-specific details. Our hope is that they will benefit anyone interested in better exposure of DNA-derived occurrence data through general biodiversity data platforms, including national biodiversity portals. This paper provides a brief rationale and an overview of the guidelines, an up-to-date version of which is maintained at https://doi.org/10.35035/doc-vf1a-nr22.

By incorporating regional socioeconomic conditions into household bargaining theory, 4 hypotheses for each region were derived. The hypotheses were tested using cross-classified multilevel regressions and the German Socio-Economic Panel (1992–2012) combined with regional economic indicators. First, gender-specific determinants of couples' West–West (i.e., within West Germany) and East-to-West migration were analyzed; second, subsequent economic consequences were investigated by comparing couples with singles. The results confirm that gender differences in macro-conditions can impose decision logics that seemingly contradict the initial power relation within couples. Despite more traditional gender arrangements in West Germany, well-educated partnered women earn significant absolute and relative income gains from migration; their egalitarian East German counterparts suffer significant losses compared with single women and East German men.},

We define species as the smallest aggregation of populations (sexual) or lineagcs (asexual) diagnosable by a unique combination of character states in comparable individuals (semaphoronts). A character state is an inherited attribute distributed among all comparable individuals (semaphoronts) of the same historical population, clade, or terminal lineage. This definition of species is character‐based and pattern oriented. Evolutionary explanations of phylogenetic species are consistent with contemporary explanations of processes of speciation, but require only the assumption of nested hierarchical pattern. We discuss the compatibility of the phylogenetic species concept with various biological needs for species and justify its use at the exclusion of alternative species concepts.},

  abstract = {Strategy Foreword The Soria Moria declaration's statements on aquaculture were addressed in the Gov-ernment's Strategy for a Competitive Norwegian Aquaculture Industry, presented in August 2007. On the subject of protecting the environment, we wrote that the Govern-ment " will ensure that the Norwegian aquaculture industry is run on a sustainable basis. " Strategy for an Eco-friendly, Sustainable Aquaculture Industry is a follow-up to and extension of the competition strategy, concerning sustainability. Aquaculture is a vital industry in Norway. It creates jobs and value. Know-how has been acquired which can be used to develop and improve aquaculture production in this country, and to help Norwegian companies break into other markets than the country's traditional ones. Aquaculture also creates spin-off effects for the supply and processing industries. It brings life to the coast and growth to rural districts and towns. Seafood is healthy, and scientists recommend that we eat more fish, which is why the Govern-ment wants to develop the industry further. The greatest potential for growth is in the farming of salmon, cod and shellfish. Growth in the aquaculture industry cannot be determined solely by market demand; it must occur within the limits that the environ-ment can tolerate. This entails that a ceiling has to be set for how large the industry can become, and ensuring that production remains within what the environment can cope with is a determinative factor in making this assessment. Eco-friendly, sustainable production is therefore a precondition for long-term development and growth. A sustainable aquaculture industry is one which is run with consideration for the envi-ronment, and adapted to the marine environment and biological diversity. As a food pro-ducer, the aquaculture industry depends on good environmental conditions and water quality, which means that in order to protect their own businesses, fish farmers have an obvious interest in maintaining good water quality and avoiding any negative impact on their surroundings. It is important to ensure a clean marine environment and good pro-duction locations for aquaculture, with minimum impact from long-distance transport emissions and pollution from more local sources. Similarly, the authorities and industry must cooperate to ensure that aquaculture is run to the benefit of its surroundings, and not to their detriment. Those involved in the aquaculture industry are invited to collaborate in order to fulfil the goals of this strategy, which is to ensure that the Norwegian aquaculture industry is run in the most sustainable manner possible.},

  abstract = {Models that estimate rates of energy flow in complex food webs often fail to account for species-specific prey selectivity of diverse consumer guilds. While DNA metabarcoding is increasingly used for dietary studies, methodological biases have limited its application for food web modeling. Here, we used data from dietary metabarcoding studies of zooplankton to calculate prey selectivity indices and assess energy fluxes in a pelagic resource-consumer network. We show that food web dynamics are influenced by prey selectivity and temporal match-mismatch in growth cycles and that cyanobacteria are the main source of primary production in the investigated coastal pelagic food web. The latter challenges the common assumption that cyanobacteria are not supporting food web productivity, a result that is increasingly relevant as global warming promotes cyanobacteria dominance. While this study provides a method for how DNA metabarcoding can be used to quantify energy fluxes in a marine food web, the approach presented here can easily be extended to other ecosystems.           ,              A flux-based model incorporating molecular diet data reveals the importance of feeding selectivity in shaping food web dynamics.},

However, the number of reads produced per sequencing run far exceeds the number required per sample for many applications, compelling researchers to sequence multiple samples per run in order to maximize efficiency. For studies that include a PCR step, this can be accomplished using primers that include an index sequence allowing sample origin to be determined after sequencing. The use of indexed primers assumes they behave no differently than standard primers; however, we found that indexed primers cause substantial template sequence-specific bias, resulting in radically different profiles of the same environmental sample. Likely the outcome of differential amplification efficiency due to primertemplate mismatch, two indexed primer sets spuriously change the inferred sequence abundance from the same DNA extraction by up to 77.1\%. We demonstrate that a double PCR approach alleviates these effects in applications where indexed primers are necessary.},

Although fishing activity dominated the footprint of impacts in national waters, climate stressors drove the expansion and intensification of impacts. Mitigating impacts on at-risk biodiversity is critical to supporting resilient marine ecosystems, and identifying the co-occurrence of impacts across multiple taxonomic groups highlights opportunities to amplify the benefits of conservation management.},

  abstract = {The worldwide fast growing aquaculture industry has caused a growing attention and concern on the more societal aspects of the industry, among them the environmental effects of aquaculture on coastal ecosystems. This has spawned new legislation, but also research activity to support legislation, management practices, and actions taken by the industry to reduce environmental impact. As a broad fundamental perspective for management, an emerging view is that fish farms should be managed as a part of the marine ecosystem according to a principle of ―Ecosystem-based Approach to Aquaculture‖. There is so far no general concept of understanding and sufficient knowledge as to how potential harmful impact on open water ecosystems can be assessed and managed. Benthic impacts are better understood and managed, but there is still a general lack of standardisation and agreement on monitoring practices. The main objective of the present report is to review and evaluate the state of knowledge from the recent accumulating international literature on environmental impact of aquaculture caused by nutrient emission to coastal waters. Individual fish release nutrients as dissolved inorganic nutrients through excretion (NH4 and PO4), particulate organic nutrients (PON and POP) through defecation, and dissolved organic nutrients (DON and DOP) through resuspension from the particulate fractions. On the scale of a fish farm, there will additionally be a direct loss of Feed-N and Feed-P (uneaten feed). These different waste components will affect different parts of the marine ecosystem; feed losses and the larger faeces particles will sink and affect sediments and benthic communities whereas dissolved inorganic nutrients, dissolved organic nutrients, and small faeces particles affect the pelagic communities and state and quality of euphotic waters. The release rate of nutrient wastes from intensive aquaculture can be estimated by mass balance based on statistical information on feed use and fish production, combined with information on feed losses, contents of N and P in the feed and the fish, and assimilation efficiencies of the dominant N and P components of the feed. Such estimates are particularly robust for N when feed losses are low, feed production in the system is low, and the statistical information is adequate for the purpose. Use of P-components from higher plants in the feed introduces a major uncertainty in the assimilation efficiency of P in the fish, making estimates more uncertain. An alternative approach for estimating waste emission rates from aquaculture, although not that robust, is to estimate waste losses by dynamic metabolically based modelling of fish feeding, growth, and metabolism. An estimation of waste emission by mass balance made for salmon cage aquaculture with an overall feed conversion efficiency of 1.16 kg dry feed per kg fish produced shows that slightly less than 2/3 of N and P of the feed is released as wastes. NH4 is the main waste component of N whereas particulate P is the main component of P. Feed-N, Feed-P, DON, and DOP are all minor waste components of salmon aquaculture. The estimations agree generally well with measured published values. N and P are not toxins, but biogenic elements which are potential harmful in the marine environment only if their supply exceeds the assimilation capacity of the ecosystem. All ecosystems have an inherent capacity of persistence, and smaller changes in nutrient supply are mitigated through adaptive responses of the communities. The scientific understanding of these processes and impacts in benthic ecosystems is well developed, but this is not the case for pelagic ecosystems. We propose that the assimilation capacity of nutrients of the water column ecosystem is mediated by two main mechanisms: 1) Nutrient uptake by phytoplankton and further transfer to higher trophic levels and 2) Dilution of nutrients and organisms mediated by hydrodynamics at production sites and their surrounding, downstream water masses. Both mechanisms will be important in a general scientific scheme, which can support management of the pelagic system. Hydrodynamics is most important; high energy is paramount for large intensive fish farms. Management of pelagic impacts require monitoring on a regional scale, because the potential environmental effects will normally become expressed on a regional scale of the fish farm. Satellite imaging and 3D modelling are suitable means for monitoring and managing these effects, in addition to more classical measurements. Particulate nutrients affect the sediments and benthic ecosystems below fish farms and in the immediate surrounding area. It is quite well understood how these accumulations of nutrient wastes distribute in sediments as a consequence of fish production, bottom topography, water current velocity and water depth. Severe accumulations can cause major changes in the structure and function of benthic ecosystems locally, i.e., normally resulting in decreasing diversity of the benthic fauna and flora. The common result is highly reduced conditions due to sulphide accumulation with a shift in decomposition of organic matter from fauna mediated to microbial processes. Oxic microbial processes like nitrification are inhibited, and this may also limit denitrification due to low nitrate concentration and sulphide toxicity. The result is high ammonium and phosphate release from fish farm sediments. There are a number of methods and models to classify and assess trophic state of sediments, which can support a scientifically based monitoring and management of benthic impacts from aquaculture in coastal sites. There are an increasing number of papers published on environmental interactions of aquaculture made available in ISI Web of Science databases over the last decades. The fraction of papers treating environmental aspects of aquaculture was 16\% of the total numbers of aquaculture papers for the period 1990-1999 and 20\% for 2000-2006. The corresponding fraction combining aquaculture and eutrophication for 1990-1999 and 2000-2006 were 1.4 (29 papers) and 2.4\% (92 papers), respectively, corresponding to about 10\% of the environmental papers related to aquaculture. There are as expected far more contributions for the benthic impacts of aquaculture than for the pelagic, which still lacks a general scientific concept that can support identification and management. The report summarise more recent, important contributions for eutrophication and aquaculture in general and for benthic and pelagic impacts. Finally, the report recommends R\&D actions to fill gaps of knowledge needed to meet requirements of future, international legislation.},

Many               SDM               s have been developed over the past decades, with a focus on space‐ and more recently, time‐dependence. However, most of these studies have been on terrestrial species and applications to marine species have been limited. In this study, we used three large spatio‐temporal data sources (habitat maps, survey‐based fish density estimates, and fishery catch data) and a novel space‐time model to study how the distribution of fishing may affect the seasonal dynamics of a commercially important fish species (Pacific Dover sole,               Microstomus pacificus               ) off the west coast of the               USA               . Dover sole showed a large scale change in seasonal and annual distribution of biomass, and its distribution shifted from mid‐depth zones to inshore or deeper waters during late summer/early fall. In many cases, the scale of fishery removal was small compared to these broader changes in biomass, suggesting that seasonal dynamics were primarily driven by movement and not by fishing. The increasing availability of appropriate data and space‐time modeling software should facilitate extending this work to many other species, particularly those in marine ecosystems, and help tease apart the role of growth, natural mortality, recruitment, movement, and fishing on spatial patterns of species distribution in marine systems.},

  abstract = {Predicting the future trend and viability of populations is an essential task in ecology. Because many populations respond to changing environments, uncertainty surrounding environmental responses must be incorporated into population assessments. However, understanding the effects of environmental variation on population dynamics requires information on several important demographic parameters that are often difficult to estimate. Integrated population models facilitate the integration of time series data on population size and all existing demographic information from a species, allowing the estimation of demographic parameters for which limited or no empirical data exist. Although these models are ideal for assessments of population viability, they have so far not included environmental uncertainty. We incorporated environmental variation in an integrated population model to account for both demographic and environmental uncertainty in an assessment of population viability. In addition, we used this model to estimate true juvenile survival, an important demographic parameter for population dynamics that is difficult to estimate empirically. We applied this model to assess the past and future population trend of a rare island endemic songbird, the Montserrat Oriole               Icterus oberi               , which is threatened by volcanic activity. Montserrat Orioles experienced lower survival in years with volcanic ashfall, causing periodic population declines that were compensated by higher seasonal fecundity in years with high pre‐breeding season rainfall. Due to the inclusion of both demographic and environmental uncertainty in the model, the estimated population growth rate in the immediate future was highly imprecise (95\% credible interval 0.844–1.105), and the probability of extinction after three generations (in the year 2028) was low (2.1\%). This projection demonstrates that accounting for both demographic and environmental sources of uncertainty provides a more realistic assessment of the viability of populations under unknown future environmental conditions.},

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-α-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 Å for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21\% with default Glide SP settings to 58\% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63\% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40\% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

Antimicrobial resistance in bacteria associated with food animals receives much attention, and drug use in aquaculture is also an important issue. There are many differences between aquatic and terrestrial management systems, such as the methods used for administration of drugs. Unique problems are related to the application of drugs in aquatic environments. Residual drugs in fish products can affect people who consume them, and antimicrobials released into aquatic environments can select for resistant bacteria. Moreover, these antimicrobial-resistant bacteria, or their resistance genes, can be transferred to humans. To decrease the risks associated with the use of antimicrobials, various regulations have been developed. In addition, it is necessary to prevent bacterial diseases in aquatic animals by vaccination, to improve culture systems, and to monitor the amount of antimicrobial drugs used and the prevalence of antimicrobial-resistant bacteria.},

  abstract = {Highly selective fishing has the potential to permanently change the characteristics within a population and could drive the decline of genetic diversity. European lobster is an intensively fished crustacean species in the Adriatic Sea which reaches high market value. Since knowledge of population structure and dynamics is important for effective fisheries management, in this study, we used 14 neutral microsatellites loci and partial mitochondrial COI region sequencing to explore population connectivity and genetic structure by comparing samples from the Adriatic Sea and the adjacent basins of the Mediterranean Sea. The obtained results suggest that neutral genetic diversity has not been significantly affected by decrease in population size due to overfishing, habitat degradation and other anthropogenic activities. Global genetic differentiation across all populations was low (               F                                ST                              = 0.0062). Populations from the Adriatic Sea were panmictic, while genetic differentiation was found among populations from different Mediterranean basins. Observed gene flow for European lobster suggest that populations in the north eastern Adriatic act as a source for surrounding areas, emphasizing the need to protect these populations by establishing interconnected MPAs that will be beneficial for both fisheries and conservation management.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Functional diversity is a component of biodiversity that generally concerns the range of things that organisms do in communities and ecosystems. Here, we review how functional diversity can explain and predict the impact of organisms on ecosystems and thereby provide a mechanistic link between the two. Critical points in developing predictive measures of functional diversity are the choice of functional traits with which organisms are distinguished, how the diversity of that trait information is summarized into a measure of functional diversity, and that the measures of functional diversity are validated through quantitative analyses and experimental tests. There is a vast amount of trait information available for plant species and a substantial amount for animals. Choosing which traits to include in a particular measure of functional diversity will depend on the specific aims of a particular study. Quantitative methods for choosing traits and for assigning weighting to traits are being developed, but need much more work before we can be confident about trait choice. The number of ways of measuring functional diversity is growing rapidly. We divide them into four main groups. The first, the number of functional groups or types, has significant problems and researchers are more frequently using measures that do not require species to be grouped. Of these, some measure diversity by summarizing distances between species in trait space, some by estimating the size of the dendrogram required to describe the difference, and some include information about species’ abundances. We show some new and important differences between these, as well as what they indicate about the responses of assemblages to loss of individuals. There is good experimental and analytical evidence that functional diversity can provide a link between organisms and ecosystems but greater validation of measures is required. We suggest that non‐significant results have a range of alternate explanations that do not necessarily contradict positive effects of functional diversity. Finally, we suggest areas for development of techniques used to measure functional diversity, highlight some exciting questions that are being addressed using ideas about functional diversity, and suggest some directions for novel research.},

  abstract = {Previous studies of relationships among the subspecies of snapping turtles (               Chelydra serpentina               \vphantom\{\} based on morphological and osteological characters have been inconclusive. We investigated relationships among the four currently recognized subspecies using restriction endonuclease fragment patterns of mtDNA and protein electrophoresis. Sixteen six‐based recognizing restriction endonucleases yielded 90 variable fragments that define 11 different haplotypes. Individuals of the two North American subspecies,               C. s. osceola               and               C. s. serpentina               , are closely related, differing by a maximum of 0.5\% sequence divergence. The Central American subspecies,               C. s. rossignonii               and               C. s. acutirostris               , are more distinct, both from each other (a minimum of 1.7\% sequence divergence) and from the North American samples (an average of 4.45\% sequence divergence). The degree of allozymic variation among the four subspecies was found to be limited and could not be used to diagnose the four recognized subspecies. The mtDNA data presented here support the species‐level distinctness of               C. s. rossignonii               and               C. s. acutirostris               from each other and from a               C. s serpentina‐C. s. osceola               complex. The recognition of three distinctive groups of               Chelydra               rather than one widespread polytypic species has important conservation implications because it focuses attention on the poorly known middle and South American species.                        ,                             Estudios previos sobre las relaciones entre las súbespecies de la tortuga               Chelydra serpentina               , basados en caracteres morfológicos y osteológicos no han sido concluyentes. En el presente estudio investigamos la relación entre cuatro subespecies reconocidas en la actualidad usando patrones de fragmentos de endonucleasas de restricción de ADN mitocondrial y electroforesis de enzimas. Dieciseis endonucleasas de restricción que reconocen 6 bases proveyeron 90 fragmentos variables que definen 11 haplotipos diferentes. Los individuos de dos especies de Norte América,               C. s. osceola               y               C. s. serpentina               , están relacionados estrechamente, difiriendo en un máximo de 0.5\% de divergencia de secuencias. Las especies de América Central,               C. s. rossignonii               y               C. s. acutirostris               , son mas distintas entre sí (con un mínimo de 1.7\% de divergencia de secuencias) y distintas del complejo               C. s. serpentina‐C. s. osceola               . El reconocimiento de tres grupos distintivos de               Chelydra               en lugar de una especie politípica de amplia distribución tiene importantes implicaciones para la conservación, debido a que enfoca la atención en las especies menos conocidas de Meso y Sud América.},

  abstract = {A principal function of the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) is to “perform regular and timely assessments of knowledge on biodiversity.” In December 2013, its second plenary session approved a program to begin a global assessment in 2015. The Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) and five other biodiversity-related conventions have adopted IPBES as their science-policy interface, so these assessments will be important in evaluating progress toward the CBD’s Aichi Targets of the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011–2020. As a contribution toward such assessment, we review the biodiversity of eukaryote species and their extinction rates, distributions, and protection. We document what we know, how it likely differs from what we do not, and how these differences affect biodiversity statistics. Interestingly, several targets explicitly mention “known species”—a strong, if implicit, statement of incomplete knowledge. We start by asking how many species are known and how many remain undescribed. We then consider by how much human actions inflate extinction rates. Much depends on where species are, because different biomes contain different numbers of species of different susceptibilities. Biomes also suffer different levels of damage and have unequal levels of protection. How extinction rates will change depends on how and where threats expand and whether greater protection counters them. Advances Recent studies have clarified where the most vulnerable species live, where and how humanity changes the planet, and how this drives extinctions. These data are increasingly accessible, bringing greater transparency to science and governance. Taxonomic catalogs of plants, terrestrial vertebrates, freshwater fish, and some marine taxa are sufficient to assess their status and the limitations of our knowledge. Most species are undescribed, however. The species we know best have large geographical ranges and are often common within them. Most known species have small ranges, however, and such species are typically newer discoveries. The numbers of known species with very small ranges are increasing quickly, even in well-known taxa. They are geographically concentrated and are disproportionately likely to be threatened or already extinct. We expect unknown species to share these characteristics. Current rates of extinction are about 1000 times the background rate of extinction. These are higher than previously estimated and likely still underestimated. Future rates will depend on many factors and are poised to increase. Finally, although there has been rapid progress in developing protected areas, such efforts are not ecologically representative, nor do they optimally protect biodiversity. Outlook Progress on assessing biodiversity will emerge from continued expansion of the many recently created online databases, combining them with new global data sources on changing land and ocean use and with increasingly crowdsourced data on species’ distributions. Examples of practical conservation that follow from using combined data in Colombia and Brazil can be found at www.savingspecies.org and www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3zjeJW2NVk.},

While there are several experimental studies that report quantitative metabarcoding results, there are a similar number that fail to do so. Here, we provide the rationale to understand under what circumstances the technique can be quantitative. In essence, we simulate a mixture of DNA of S species with a defined initial abundance distribution. In the simulated PCR, each species increases its concentration following a certain amplification efficiency. The final DNA concentration will reflect the initial one when the efficiency is similar for all species; otherwise, the initial and final DNA concentrations would be poorly related. Although there are many known factors that modulate amplification efficiency, we focused on the number of primer–template mismatches, arguably the most important one. We used 15 common primers pairs targeting the mitochondrial COI region and the mitogenomes of ca. 1,200 insect species. The results showed that some primers pairs produced quantitative results under most circumstances, whereas some other primers failed to do so. In conclusion, depending on the primer pair used in the PCR amplification and on the characteristics of the mixture analysed (i.e., high species richness, low evenness), DNA metabarcoding can provide a quantitative estimate of the relative abundances of different species.},

Assessing the adequacy of current fisheries management under changing climate: a southern synopsis. – ICES Journal of Marine Science, 68: 1305–1317. Climate change is likely to have a significant impact on both target and non-target marine stocks worldwide, with the concomitant need for management strategies capable of sustaining fishing in future. We use several southern hemisphere fisheries to highlight the likely impacts of climate change at a range of levels, from individual to population responses, as well as ecosystem ramifications. Examples span polar (Antarctic krill fishery), temperate (west coast pelagic fishery, abalone and rock lobster), and tropical (Torres Strait rock lobster) commercially important fisheries. Responses of these fisheries to either past observed environmental changes or projected future changes are used to deduce some anticipated implications of climate change for fisheries management, including economic impacts and governance considerations. We evaluate the effectiveness of current single-species assessment models, management strategy evaluation approaches and multispecies assessment models as future management tools to cope with likely climate-related changes. Non-spatial stock assessment models will have limited ability to separate fishery effects from the impacts of climate change. Anthropogenic climate change is occurring at a time-scale relevant to current fisheries management strategic planning and testing.

  abstract = {Abstract             Understanding and predicting the distribution of organisms in heterogeneous environments lies at the heart of ecology. The spatial distribution of fish populations observed in the wild results from the complex interactions of multiple controls both external or internal to the fish populations. Whilst species distribution models (SDMs) have been mostly concerned with static description of species distribution as a function of environmental constraints, models of animal movements (MAMs) have focussed on the dynamic nature of spatial distribution of groups of individuals under a number of constraints external and internal to the population. Besides SDMs and MAMs, modelling the spatial distribution of fish populations can be achieved by models that are fundamentally static (like SDMs) but can also incorporate many hypotheses on the control of fish spatial distribution (like MAMs). The hypotheses underlying these models need to make sense at the population level ‐ rather than at the individual or species level –we term these ‘population distribution models’ (PDMs). PDMs are statistical models that rely on several hypotheses, which include: (i) control through geographical attachment, (ii) environmental conditions, (iii) density‐dependent habitat selection, (iv) spatial dependency, (v) population demographic structure, (vi) species interactions and (vii) population memory. We review the basis behind each of these conceptual models and we examine corresponding numerical applications. We argue that the conceptual models are complementary rather than competing, that existing numerical applications are still rarely compared and combined, and that PDMs can offer a statistical framework to achieve this. We recommend that the numerical models associated with different hypotheses be constructed within such a common general framework. This will permit evaluation, comparison and combination of the multiple hypotheses on fish spatial distribution. It will ultimately lead to a more comprehensive understanding of the factors controlling the spatial distribution of fish populations and to more accurate predictions in which model uncertainty is accounted for.},

In this study, we tested the applicability of using foraminiferal-specific high-throughput sequencing (HTS) metabarcoding for monitoring these habitats. Sediment samples and physico-chemical data were collected along an enrichment gradient radiating out from three Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) farms in New Zealand. HTS of environmental DNA and RNA (eDNA/eRNA) resulted in 1,875,300 sequences that clustered into 349 Operational Taxonomic Units. Strong correlations were observed among various biotic indices calculated from MI data and normalized fourth-root transformed HTS data. Correlations were stronger using eRNA compared to eDNA data. Quantile regression spline analyses identified 12 key foraminiferal taxa that have potential to be used as bioindicator species. This study demonstrates the huge potential for using this method for biomonitoring of fish-farming and other marine industrial activities.},

Understanding of the mechanisms linking environment to recruitment is essential for the effective management of fisheries resources. In this study, we used a fully coupled end‐to‐end ecosystem model to study the effect of climate variability on sardine recruitment in the California Current System during 1965–2006. Ocean variability was represented by               ROMS               hydrodynamic and               NEMURO               biogeochemical models, and sardine population dynamics was simulated through a full life cycle individual‐based model. Model analysis was designed to elucidate how changes in abiotic and biotic conditions may impact the spawning habitats, early life stage survival, and ultimately recruitment of sardine. Our findings revealed the importance of spatial processes to shape early life stages dynamics. Shifts in spawning habitats were dictated by the spatial variations in temperature and the behavioral movement of adults. Additionally, the spatial match of eggs with warmer temperatures and larvae with their prey influenced their survival. The northward shifts in spawning locations and the accomplishment of good recruitment in warmer years agreed with existing knowledge. Egg production and survival during egg and yolk‐sac larval stages were key factors to drive the long‐term variations in recruitment. Finally, our analysis provided a quantitative assessment of climate impact on year‐to‐year variation in sardine recruitment by integrating multiple hypotheses.},

Using an extensive array of observations, the authors document AWwarming trends across various time scales and demonstrate that the 2000s were exceptionally warm, with no analogy since the 1950s or probably in the history of instrumental observations in the Arctic Ocean. Warming in the recent decade was dominated by a warmAWpulse in addition to the underlying trend. Since 1997, the Canadian Basin experienced a faster warming rate compared with the Eurasian Basin. The relative role of the AW warmth in setting the net energy flux and mass balance of the Arctic sea ice is still under debate.

  abstract = {In this study, we propose a new Arctic climate change indicator based on the strength of the Arctic halocline, a porous barrier between the cold and fresh upper ocean and ice and the warm intermediate Atlantic Water of the Arctic Ocean. This indicator provides a measure of the vulnerability of sea ice to upward heat fluxes from the ocean interior, as well as the efficiency of mixing affecting carbon and nutrient exchanges. It utilizes the well-accepted calculation of available potential energy (APE), which integrates anomalies of potential density from the surface downwards through the surface mixed layer to the base of the halocline. Regional APE contrasts are striking and show a strengthening of stratification in the Amerasian Basin (AB) and an overall weakening in the Eurasian Basin (EB). In contrast, Arctic-wide time series of APE is not reflective of these inter-basin contrasts. The use of two time series of APE-AB and EB-as an indicator of Arctic Ocean climate change provides a powerful tool for detecting and monitoring transition of the Arctic Ocean towards a seasonally ice-free Arctic Ocean. This new, straightforward climate indicator can be used to inform both the scientific community and the broader public about changes occurring in the Arctic Ocean interior and their potential impacts on the state of the ice cover, the productivity of marine ecosystems and mid-latitude weather.},

Having accurate techniques for determining dietary ranges and components is critical for this endeavour. While visual analyses and early molecular approaches are highly labour intensive and often lack resolution, recent DNA‐based approaches potentially provide more accurate methods for dietary studies. A suite of approaches have been used based on the identification of consumed species by characterization of DNA present in gut or faecal samples. In one approach, a standardized DNA region (DNA barcode) is PCR amplified, amplicons are sequenced and then compared to a reference database for identification. Initially, this involved sequencing clones from PCR products, and studies were limited in scale because of the costs and effort required. The recent development of next generation sequencing (NGS) has made this approach much more powerful, by allowing the direct characterization of dozens of samples with several thousand sequences per PCR product, and has the potential to reveal many consumed species simultaneously (DNA metabarcoding). Continual improvement of NGS technologies, on‐going decreases in costs and current massive expansion of reference databases make this approach promising. Here we review the power and pitfalls of NGS diet methods. We present the critical factors to take into account when choosing or designing a suitable barcode. Then, we consider both technical and analytical aspects of NGS diet studies. Finally, we discuss the validation of data accuracy including the viability of producing quantitative data.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Environmental DNA (eDNA) is an effective tool for describing fish biodiversity in lotic environments, but the downstream transport of eDNA released by organisms makes it difficult to interpret species detection at the local scale. In addition to biophysical degradation and exchanges at the water–sediment interface, hydrological conditions control the transport distance. A new eDNA transport model described in this paper considers downstream retention and degradation processes in combination with hydraulic conditions and assumes that the sedimentation rate of very fine particles is a correct estimate of the eDNA deposition rate. Based on meta‐analyses of available studies, the particle size distribution of fish eDNA (PSD), the relationship between the sedimentation rate and the size of very fine particles in suspension, and the influence of temperature on the degradation rate of fish eDNA were successively modelled. After combining the results in a mechanistic‐based model, the eDNA uptake distances (distance required to retain 63.21\% of the eDNA particles in the riverbed) observed in a compilation of previous experimental studies were correctly simulated. eDNA degradation is negligible at low flow and temperature but has a comparable influence to background transfer when hydraulic conditions allow a long uptake distance. The wide prediction intervals associated with the simulations reflect the complexity of the processes acting on eDNA after shedding. This model can be useful for estimating eDNA detection distance downstream from a source point and discussing the possibility of false positive detection in eDNA samples, as shown in an example.},

  abstract = {This paper explores a number of issues surrounding the current assessment of the Bering-Chukchi-Beaufort (B-C-B) Seas stock of bowhead whales and provides a ‘preferred’ set of specifications for this assessment. A Bayesian approach appears to be preferable. However, the Bayesian Synthesis method is subject to the Borel paradox. Reverting to a ‘standard’ Bayesian approach which places all ‘indirect’ nformation in priors (rather than representing this information as likelihoods) would overcome this problem. The basis for the prior distributions used should be documented clearly, and the sources of information for the B-C-B bowhead stock divided into ‘indirect’ and ‘direct’. Simulation results and ‘in principle” arguments support the choice of a current population size rather than the pre-exploitation equilibrium size for the parameter to scale the population size (i.e. a *backwards’ rather than a ‘forwards’ approach). Arguments are presented that the most appropriate choice for a productivity-related parameter, for which a prior has to be specified, is the maximum steady rate of increase. A method for treating the Ny/P, estimates as relative indices of abundance, allowing for prior information about the relationship between absolute abundance and those estimates, and accounting for the correlation among the indices of relative abundance ‘derived from the N, and P, data is developed. Two ‘preferred approaches’ for assessing the resource both lead to estimates for the lower 5 percentile of the replacement yield that are greater than the current annual strike limit of 67 for the B-C-B stock.},

Using a 25 yr record of satellite-derived geostrophic and Ekman velocity fields, Lagrangian particle tracking simulations were implemented to find pathways of passively drifting virtual particles representing rockfish larvae. Statistical fates of particles were averaged to reveal mean spatial and temporal patterns in retention and distance traveled. Yearly retention values were compared to observed pelagic juvenile rockfish abundance collected on annual surveys. Retention patterns varied spatially throughout the region, with the Southern California Bight emerging as a highly retentive region. Interannual variability in overall retention was positively related to the abundance of pelagic juvenile rockfish collected in the same year. Our analyses provide evidence supporting the successful implementation of the geographic placement of the Cowcod Conservation Areas, which were spatial closures implemented in the early 2000s to rebuild overfished rockfishes, and illustrate the utility of numerical simulations for understanding the retention and transport of pelagic larvae such as rockfish.},

I study the government of refugees and migrants in order to examine capitalist value regimes. Societal values and hierarchies reflected in capitalist modes of production impact on struggles of racialised subaltern groups to translate body power into valued labour. Marx’s account of surplus populations points to the common marginalisations of people called ‘refugees’ and other subaltern groups struggling to translate their body power into valorised labour. The essay includes a study of the gentrification of a district in Budapest, and its transformation into a means for the reproduction of capital, leading to the marginalisation of groups who no longer fit the new value regimes. Studying refugees as surplus populations allows for a sense of the common marginalisations of subaltern and racialised groups before capitalism, and questions the treatment of refugees and migrants as ‘strangers’.},

  abstract = {Fisheries management involves a broad and complex set of tasks that are necessary to prevent overfishing and to help the recovery of overfished stock. Monitoring fishing activities based on two main sources, landings data and scientific surveys, is a challenging task. Fisheries collection data is often limited, which compromises the accuracy of the results obtained. Therefore, several emerging applications of molecular methods have the potential to provide unique understanding of ecological processes in marine environments and to build stronger empirical underpinnings for the Ecosystem-Based Fisheries Management. Environmental DNA (eDNA) is a complex mixture of genetic material shed by those organisms that inhabit a given environment, whereby DNA is extracted from an environmental sample without accessing the target organism. eDNA studies can be categorized into two main approaches, i) eDNA metabarcoding or semi-targeted (community) approaches and ii) species-specific or targeted approaches (single). Although both categories are often discussed, they differ drastically in their methodology, interpretations and accuracy. Both approaches involve a series of steps that include eDNA capture, preservation, extraction and amplification. This detection will depend on the affinity to the targeted taxa sequences and completeness and accuracy of DNA reference collection databases. The eDNA method applied in marine environments are probably the most challenging aquatic environments for applying this technique. This is because of the extreme relationship between water-volume to biomass, dynamics and the physical and chemical properties of seawater that affect dispersion, dilution and preservation. Here, we review the present application of this novel method in fishery assessment in marine environments. To date, many studies suggest that this method offers the potential to revolutionize fisheries monitoring, which will contribute to improving the range of tasks involved in fisheries management. The compelling conclusion is that the methodological steps including in eDNA surveys should be standardized and that research efforts should focus on developing appropriately validated tests to address environmental and sampling factors that may affect eDNA detection in marine environments in order to draw reliable conclusions. This bioassessment tool can assist fisheries professionals in achieve their research, management, and conservation objectives, but not as a replacement for time-proven assessment methods.},

To examine the potential for eDNA to support marine fisheries monitoring surveys, we optimized an eDNA isolation method, developed a multispecies assay and tested it on eDNA samples collected along the Pacific coast of the United States. Four commercial DNA extraction kits that exploit the capability of the nucleic acids binding a solid phase (two using a silica matrix and two magnetic beads) as well an organic separation method were tested. A species-specific multiplex qPCR assay was developed and tested to simultaneously target Pacific hake (               Merluccius productus               ), Pacific lamprey (               Entosphenus tridentatus               ) and eulachon (               Thaleichthys pacificus               ). The specificity of the assay was tested in silico, in vitro and in natura. Environmental DNA isolation using phenol:chloroform:isoamyl purification with a phase lock was optimized and yielded the highest amount of total and target DNA and was used to extract 46 marine water samples for the detection of the three species of interest. The multiplex qPCR assay used in the quantification process was also optimized to provide convenience and accuracy. Pacific hake was present in 44\% of the eDNA samples while the other two species were absent. Here, we present a complete workflow for the simultaneous detection and quantification of multiple marine fish species using eDNA. This workflow supports large-scale at-sea sampling efforts with preservation at ambient temperatures and has demonstrated DNA extraction efficiency and reliability. The multiplex qPCR assay is shown to be sensitive and specific for the purposes of simultaneously monitoring the relative abundance of multiple targeted fish species.},

Understanding the genetic signatures of range shifts can help build our knowledge of the capacity of species to establish and persist in colonised areas. Here, seven microsatellite loci were used to examine the population connectivity, genetic structure and diversity of               Octopus tetricus               , which has extended its distribution several hundred kilometres polewards associated with the southwards extension of the warm East Australian Current along south-eastern Australia. The historical distribution and the range extension zones had significant genetic differences but levels of genetic diversity were comparable. The population in the range extension zone was sub-structured, contained relatively high levels of self-recruitment and was sourced by migrants from along the entire geographic distribution. Genetic bottlenecks and changes in population size were detected throughout the range extension axis. Persistent gene flow from throughout the historical zone and moderate genetic diversity may buffer the genetic bottlenecks and favour the range extension of               O. tetricus               . These characteristics may aid adaptation, establishment, and long-term persistence of the population in the range extension zone.},

Although extensive validation and benchmarking work remains before eDNA can be integrated into fish stock assessment frameworks, important preliminary eDNA research underscores the potential of eDNA to drive advancement from stock assessments limited to trawl survey and catch data toward the implementation of EBFM. The key challenge moving forward, however, will be establishing an acceptable balance between new knowledge and uncertainty, particularly regarding false negatives, as well as eDNA degradation and transport rates. Furthermore, eDNA methods are currently unsuitable for resolving fish age estimation errors, maturity status, acoustic interpretations, and life history structures, all of which are critically important for accurate stock assessments. Recent research, however, demonstrates that the immediate potential benefits for eDNA applications to accommodate resource limitations and supplement traditional survey data demand an open and constructive dialog for prompt implementation of eDNA applications within fish stock assessment streams.},

  abstract = {Abstract:               Population viability analysis ({$\quad$}PVA) has become a commonly used tool in endangered species management. There is no single process that constitutes PVA, but all approaches have in common an assessment of a population's risk of extinction (or quasi extinction) or its projected population growth either under current conditions or expected from proposed management. As model sophistication increases, and software programs that facilitate PVA without the need for modeling expertise become more available, there is greater potential for the misuse of models and increased confusion over interpreting their results. Consequently, we discuss the practical use and limitations of PVA in conservation planning, and we discuss some emerging issues of PVA. We review extant issues that have become prominent in PVA, including spatially explicit modeling, sensitivity analysis, incorporating genetics into PVA, PVA in plants, and PVA software packages, but our coverage of emerging issues is not comprehensive. We conclude that PVA is a powerful tool in conservation biology for comparing alternative research plans and relative extinction risks among species, but we suggest caution in its use: (1) because PVA is a model, its validity depends on the appropriateness of the model's structure and data quality; (2) results should be presented with appropriate assessment of confidence; (3) model construction and results should be subject to external review, and (4) model structure, input, and results should be treated as hypotheses to be tested. We also suggest (5) restricting the definition of PVA to development of a formal quantitative model, (6) focusing more research on determining how pervasive density‐dependence feedback is across species, and (7) not using PVA to determine minimum population size or (8) the specific probability of reaching extinction. The most appropriate use of PVA may be for comparing the relative effects of potential management actions on population growth or persistence.                        ,                                                             Resumen:                 El análisis de viabilidad poblacional (AVP) es una herramienta de uso común en el manejo de especies en peligro. No hay un proceso único que constituya al AVP, pero todos los enfoques tienen en común la estimación del riesgo de extinción (o cuasi extinción) o la proyección del crecimiento poblacional, ya sea bajo las condiciones actuales o las esperadas del manejo propuesto. A medida que aumenta la sofisticación del modelo, y que se dispone de programas de cómputo que facilitan el AVP sin necesidad de experiencia en modelaje, hay una mayor posibilidad de desaprovechar el modelo y una mayor confusión en la interpretación de los resultados. En consecuencia, discutimos el uso práctico y las limitaciones del AVP en la planificación de conservación y discutimos algunos temas emergentes del AVP. Revisamos temas vigentes que son prominentes en el AVP, incluyendo el modelaje espacialmente explícito, el análisis de sensibilidad, la inclusión de la genética en el AVP, AVP en plantas y paquetes de cómputo de AVP, sin embargo nuestra revisión de los temas emergentes no es amplia. Concluimos que el AVP es una herramienta poderosa para la biología de la conservación para comparar planes de investigación alternos y los riesgos de extinción entre especies, pero sugerimos precaución en su uso: (1) porque el AVP es un modelo cuya validez depende en la eficacia de la estructura del modelo y la calidad de los datos, (2) los resultados deberían presentarse con la evaluación de su confiabilidad, (3) la construcción del modelo y sus resultados deberían ser sometidos a revisión externa y (4) la estructura del modelo, los datos y los resultados deberían ser tratadas como hipótesis a probar. También sugerimos (5) restringir la definición del AVP para desarrollar un modelo cuantitativo formal, (6) realizar más investigación para determinar que tan extensa es la reacción de las especies a la denso‐dependencia y (7) no utilizar el AVP para determinar el tamaño poblacional mínimo u (8) la probabilidad específica de extinción. El uso más adecuado del AVP puede ser para comparar los efectos relativos de las acciones de manejo sobre el crecimiento de la población o su persistencia.},

Effective management requires the detection of populations, which can sometimes be at low densities and is usually based on visual detection and counting. Recently, there has been considerable interest in the detection of short species-specific environmental DNA (eDNA) fragments to allow aquatic species monitoring within different environments due to the potential of greater sensitivity over traditional survey methods which can be time-consuming and costly. Environmental DNA analysis is increasingly being used in the detection of rare or invasive species and has also been applied to eDNA persistence studies and estimations of species biomass and distribution. When combined with next-generation sequencing methods, it has been demonstrated that entire faunas can be identified. Different environments require different sampling methodologies, but there remain areas where laboratory methodologies could be standardized to allow results to be compared across studies. Synthesis and applications. We review recently published studies that use eDNA to monitor aquatic populations, discuss the methodologies used and the application of eDNA analysis as a survey tool in ecology.

Here, we coupled eDNA metabarcoding and capture trawl surveys in British Columbia, Canada, to examine species traits that explain recurrent differences in detectability between the two methods, including habitat, body size, and biomass. At the regional scale, 17 of 23 fish species (74\%) captured by the trawl were detected by eDNA metabarcoding, and 39 additional species were detected by eDNA sampling only. We found that eDNA metabarcoding disproportionately detected trawl‐caught species with greater local biomass (i.e., greater biomass in the adjacent trawl). Fish detected only in eDNA had a greater range of body lengths and a broader range of habitat preferences outside the trawls' target size and sampling areas. Our results suggest that with our level of sampling, eDNA metabarcoding can adequately recapitulate detection of fish communities detected by trawl surveys, but with a bias toward fish of high population biomass and greater inclusion of fish from outside the trawled area.},

  abstract = {Suspended biomass in the upper layer and sedimentation of organic matter were measured during spring and early summer simultaneously in Balsfjord and Malangen, northern Norway (ca 70° N) in 1992 at four different depths ranging from 30 to 170 m and 330 m, respectively. The bloom took place in almost unstratified waters in April and was dominated by diatoms and Phaeocystis pouchetii, Hariot. The biomass of the early bloom was exported from the fjord due to advection, resulting in low sedimentation rates in the fjord. Several advective episodes were observed during the course of the bloom. These were caused by large scale variation in the wind field along the coast. The bloom continued until the end of April with high POC fluxes ranging from 300-1120 mg m-2 day-1 at all depths. Suspended POC in the upper 36 m was high, varied between 16 and 31 g m-2 day-1 and was not correlated to the phytoplankton bloom. It is suggested that topographical controlled down-fjord wind stress during periods of low stratification gives rise to extensive water circulation and resuspension, in particular in narrow fjords. Advection of zooplankton into the fjords influences the vertical flux by introduction and removal of specific zooplankton stocks. The results imply that advection is a significant process for the development and fate of vernal blooms in north Norwegian fjords and that vernal blooms and pelagicbenthic coupling will be subjected to interannual variation due to variable meteorological forcing. © 1996 Taylor \& Francis Group, LLC.},

  abstract = {In this dissertation, I address fundamental ecological issues concerning widow rockfish ( Sebastes entomelas ) habitat use and distribution, which can be used as the foundation for appropriate marine reserve design. Although widow rockfish is one of the most commercially important rockfish species on the US West Coast, no previous work has specifically addressed the habitat requirements of this species. In Chapter One , I identify significant habitat associations between widow rockfish and three habitat variables; bottom depth, vertical depth of fish in the water column, and temperature. My results indicate that the average significant habitat association for widow rockfish includes bottom depths between 136–298 m, vertical depths between 101–197 m, and temperatures between 7.1–8.1°C. These results provide useful insights towards the definition of essential fish habitat (EFH) for this species. In Chapter Two , I address fluctuations in habitat use through time. I detected no significant interannual, seasonal, or intraannual variation in the range of bottom depths preferred by widow rockfish, but I did detect a significant correlation between bottom depth and vertical depth. Fish are further off the bottom at deeper bottom depths, and this relationship varies significantly by season. Understanding the ecological phenomenon affecting this behavior could provide us with additional insight into the ecology and habitat requirements of this species. Finally, in Chapter Three , I investigated widow rockfish distribution, and changes through time. I detected three significant annual shifts in the spatial distribution within an 11-year time series (1988–1998), corresponding to the two major El Niño events that occurred within this time frame. My results have the following implications for marine reserves design. First, the habitat encompassed in any marine reserve(s) designed for widow rockfish conservation must include the range of bottom depths and temperatures significantly associated with its distribution. Second, the marine reserve(s) should encompass both the inshore and offshore components of widow rockfish habitat. Finally, a single reserve may not afford equal protection to this species, particularly with regard to El Niño versus non-El Niño years. Therefore, in addition to seasonal habitat use, one must consider interannual shifts in distribution.},

Some cod stocks are predicted to collapse, but this remains speculative because almost no information is available on the thermal tolerance of cod in its natural environment. We used electronic tags to measure the thermal experience of 384 adult Atlantic cod from 8 different stocks in the northeast Atlantic. Over 100 000 d of data were collected in total. The data demonstrate that cod is an adaptable and tolerant species capable of surviving and growing in a wide range of temperate marine climates. The total thermal niche ranged from -1.5 to 19°C; this range was narrower (1 to 8°C) during the spawning season. Cod in each of the stocks studied had a thermal niche of approximately 12°C, but latitudinal differences in water temperature meant that cod in the warmer, southern regions experienced 3 times the degree days (DD; ∼4000 DD yr-1) than individuals from northern regions (∼1200 DD yr-1). Growth rates increased with temperature, reaching a maximum in those cod with a mean thermal history of between 8 and 10°C. Our direct observations of habitat occupation suggest that adult cod will be able to tolerate warming seas, but that climate change will affect cod populations at earlier life-history stages as well as exerting effects on cod prey species. © Inter-Research 2010.},

Nevertheless, aquaculture must address environmental issues as well as economic and social aspects to achieve a sustainable development. Aquaculture with native species under semi-intensive conditions is a sustainable production alternative that minimizes the impact on aquatic ecosystems. An aquaculture pilot project with pink shrimp (Farfantepenaeus paulensis) was tested in a protected lagoon in Uruguay (Laguna de Rocha). Shrimp were reared in pen enclosures within their native habitat, where natural currents drive water renewal, and the natural food supply was supplemented with commercial food. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of F. paulensis aquaculture on the water and sediment quality and the benthic community, and to estimate the maximum number of pen enclosures that Laguna de Rocha can sustain while maintaining the minimal environmental impact. A Before, After, Control Impact (BACI) sampling design was followed and the results of abiotic and biological variables were compared between treatment site (control, pens, and two areas at 15 and 50~m from the pens) and timing (before shrimp addition, during culture and after harvest), through ANOVA. The most significant impact was found inside the pens, where ammonium levels increased and benthos species richness and abundance decreased. A nitrogen-based-model was used to estimate the maximum number of pens in relation to the minimal impact on the ecosystem. Simulation indicated that up to 13 pens could be installed in the southern area of Laguna de Rocha without increasing the usual concentration of total nitrogen in other areas of the lagoon. The BACI design, the statistical analysis and the modeling tools proved to be effective, simple and low cost instruments to assess the environmental impact in a protected area. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

It is designed as an alternative to the widely used USEARCH tool (Edgar, 2010) for which the source code is not publicly available, algorithm details are only rudimentarily described, and only a memory-confined 32-bit version is freely available for academic use. Methods When searching nucleotide sequences, VSEARCH uses a fast heuristic based on words shared by the query and target sequences in order to quickly identify similar sequences, a similar strategy is probably used in USEARCH. VSEARCH then performs optimal global sequence alignment of the query against potential target sequences, using full dynamic programming instead of the seed-and-extend heuristic used by USEARCH. Pairwise alignments are computed in parallel using vectorisation and multiple threads. Results VSEARCH includes most commands for analysing nucleotide sequences available in USEARCH version 7 and several of those available in USEARCH version 8, including searching (exact or based on global alignment), clustering by similarity (using length pre-sorting, abundance pre-sorting or a user-defined order), chimera detection (reference-based or de novo), dereplication (full length or prefix), pairwise alignment, reverse complementation, sorting, and subsampling. VSEARCH also includes commands for FASTQ file processing, i.e., format detection, filtering, read quality statistics, and merging of paired reads. Furthermore, VSEARCH extends functionality with several new commands and improvements, including shuffling, rereplication, masking of low-complexity sequences with the well-known DUST algorithm, a choice among different similarity definitions, and FASTQ file format conversion. VSEARCH is here shown to be more accurate than USEARCH when performing searching, clustering, chimera detection and subsampling, while on a par with USEARCH for paired-ends read merging. VSEARCH is slower than USEARCH when performing clustering and chimera detection, but significantly faster when performing paired-end reads merging and dereplication. VSEARCH is available at https://github.com/torognes/vsearch under either the BSD 2-clause license or the GNU General Public License version 3.0. Discussion VSEARCH has been shown to be a fast, accurate and full-fledged alternative to USEARCH.

  abstract = {Background. Fish and fisheries are important for the livelihoods, food, and income of the rural population in Bangladesh. Increased rice production and changing agricultural patterns have resulted in a large decline in inland fisheries. Implementation of carp pond polyculture has been very successful, whereas little focus has been given to the commonly consumed small indigenous fish species, some of which are rich in vitamin A and minerals, such as calcium, iron, and zinc, and are an integral part of the rural diet. Objective. The overall objective of the research and capacity-building activities described in this paper is to increase the production, accessibility, and intake of nutrient-dense small indigenous fish species, in particular mola (Amblypharyngodon mola), in order to combat micronutrient deficiencies. The large contribution from small indigenous fish species to recommended intakes of vitamin A and calcium and the perception that mola is good for or protects the eyes have been well documented. Methods. An integrated approach was conducted jointly by Bangladeshi and Danish institutions, linking human nutrition and fisheries. Activities included food-consumption surveys, laboratory analyses of commonly consumed fish species, production trials of carp-mola pond polyculture, teaching, training, and dissemination of the results. Results. No decline in carp production and thus in income was found with the inclusion of mola, and increased intake of mola has the potential to combat micronutrient deficiencies. Teaching and training of graduates and field staff have led to increased awareness of the role of small indigenous fish species for good nutrition and resulted in the promotion of carp-mola pond polyculture and research in small indigenous fish species. The decline in accessibility, increase in price, and decrease in intake of small indigenous fish species by the rural poor, as well as the increased intake of silver carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix), the most commonly cultured fish species, which is poor in micronutrients and not preferred for consumption, are being addressed, and some measures taken by inland fisheries management have been discussed. Conclusions. The successful linking of human nutrition and fisheries to address micronutrient deficiencies has relevance for other countries with rich fisheries resources, such as Cambodia and countries in the Lake Victoria region of Africa. © 2007, The United Nations University.},

  abstract = {Summary                            1.               \enspace Recent advances in occupancy estimation that adjust for imperfect detection have provided substantial improvements over traditional approaches and are receiving considerable use in applied ecology. To estimate and adjust for detectability, occupancy modelling requires multiple surveys at a site and requires the assumption of ‘closure’ between surveys, i.e. no changes in occupancy between surveys. Violations of this assumption could bias parameter estimates; however, little work has assessed model sensitivity to violations of this assumption or how commonly such violations occur in nature.                                         2.               \enspace We apply a modelling procedure that can test for closure to two avian point‐count data sets in Montana and New Hampshire, USA, that exemplify time‐scales at which closure is often assumed. These data sets illustrate different sampling designs that allow testing for closure but are currently rarely employed in field investigations. Using a simulation study, we then evaluate the sensitivity of parameter estimates to changes in site occupancy and evaluate a power analysis developed for sampling designs that is aimed at limiting the likelihood of closure.                                         3.               \enspace Application of our approach to point‐count data indicates that habitats may frequently be open to changes in site occupancy at time‐scales typical of many occupancy investigations, with 71\% and 100\% of species investigated in Montana and New Hampshire respectively, showing violation of closure across time periods of 3{$\quad$}weeks and 8{$\quad$}days respectively.                                         4.               \enspace Simulations suggest that models assuming closure are sensitive to changes in occupancy. Power analyses further suggest that the modelling procedure we apply can effectively test for closure.                                         5.               \enspace{}               Synthesis and applications               . Our demonstration that sites may be open to changes in site occupancy over time‐scales typical of many occupancy investigations, combined with the sensitivity of models to violations of the closure assumption, highlights the importance of properly addressing the closure assumption in both sampling designs and analysis. Furthermore, inappropriately applying closed models could have negative consequences when monitoring rare or declining species for conservation and management decisions, because violations of closure typically lead to overestimates of the probability of occurrence.},

  abstract = {Environmental DNA (eDNA) has revolutionized our ability to identify the presence and distributions of terrestrial and aquatic organisms. Recent evidence suggests the concentration of eDNA could also provide a rapid, cost-effective indicator of abundance and/or biomass for fisheries stock assessments. Globally, fisheries resources are under immense pressure, and their sustainable harvest requires accurate information on the sizes of fished stocks. However, in many cases the required information remains elusive because of a reliance on imprecise or costly fishery-dependent and independent data. Here, we review the literature describing relationships between eDNA concentrations and fish abundance and/or biomass, as well as key influencing factors, as a precursor to determining the broader utility of eDNA for monitoring fish populations. We reviewed 63 studies published between 2012 and 2020 and found 90\% identified positive relationships between eDNA concentrations and the abundance and/or biomass of focal species. Key influencing biotic factors included the taxon examined as well as their body size, distribution, reproduction, and migration. Key abiotic factors mostly comprised hydrological processes affecting the dispersal and persistence of eDNA, especially water flow and temperature, although eDNA collection methods were also influential. The cumulative influence of these different factors likely explains the substantial variability observed in eDNA concentrations, both within and among studies. Nevertheless, there is considerable evidence to support using eDNA as an ancillary tool for assessing fish population abundance and/or biomass across discrete spatio-temporal scales, following preliminary investigations to determine species- and context-specific factors influencing the eDNA abundance/biomass relationship. Advantages of eDNA monitoring relative to other approaches include reduced costs, increased efficiencies, and nonlethal sampling.},

We hypothesized that fyke netting selects for small‐bodied fishes and electrofishing selects for large‐bodied fishes. Three sites were sampled during May (2004 and 2005), July (2005 only), and September (2004 and 2005). We found that the species composition of captured fish differed considerably between fyke netting and electrofishing based on nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMDS). Species strongly associated with fyke netting (based on NMDS and relative abundance) included the brook silverside Labidesthes sicculus, banded killifish Fundulus diaphanus, round goby Neogobius melanostomus, mimic shiner Notropis volucellus, and bluntnose minnow Pimephales notatus, whereas species associated with electrofishing included the Chinook salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha, catostomids (Moxostoma spp. and Catostomus spp.), freshwater drum Aplodinotus grunniens, walleye Sander vitreus, gizzard shad Dorosoma cepedianum, and common carp Cyprinus carpio. The total length of fish captured by electrofishing was 12.8 cm (95\% confidence interval = 5.5–17.2 cm) greater than that of fish captured by fyke netting. Size selectivity of the gears contributed to differences in species composition of the fish captured, supporting our initial hypothesis. Thus, small‐mesh fyke nets and boat electrofishers provided complementary information on a littoral fish assemblage. Our results support use of multiple gear types in monitoring and research surveys of fish assemblages.},

  abstract = {Environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding is a novel method of assessing biodiversity wherein samples are taken from the environment via water, sediment or air from which DNA is extracted, and then amplified using general or universal primers in polymerase chain reaction and sequenced using next-generation sequencing to generate thousands to millions of reads. From this data, species presence can be determined, and overall biodiversity assessed. It is an interdisciplinary method that brings together traditional field-based ecology with in-depth molecular methods and advanced computational tools. As an emerging monitoring method, there are many pitfalls and roadblocks to be considered and avoided, but the method may still have the ability to revolutionize modern biodiversity surveys for the molecular era. In this paper, we review the basic methodology, benefits, and concerns of eDNA metabarcoding, and systematically cover the applications of the method in global ecology thus far, including biodiversity monitoring across all habitats and taxonomic groups, ancient ecosystem reconstruction, plant-pollinator interactions, diet analysis, invasive species detection, pollution responses, and air quality monitoring. We also discuss the future applications of the method as well as expected technological advances and how they may impact the way that eDNA metabarcoding may used in the future. eDNA metabarcoding is a unique method still in development and will likely remain in flux for some time as technology advances and procedures become standardized. However, as metabarcoding is optimized and its use becomes more widespread, it is likely to become an essential tool for ecological monitoring and global conservation study.},

  abstract = {Climate change can alter marine ecosystems through changes in ocean temperature, acidification, circulation, and productivity. Over the last decade, the United States northeast continental shelf (U.S. NES) has warmed faster than any other marine ecosystem in the country and is among the fastest warming regions of the global ocean. Many living marine resources in the U.S. NES ranging from recreational and commercial fish stocks to protected species have shifted their distribution in response to ocean warming. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s National Marine Fisheries Service (NOAA Fisheries) is responsible for the assessment, protection, and sustainable use of the nation’s living marine resources. In the U.S. NES, NOAA Fisheries has made substantial progress on climate research related to fish, fisheries, and protected species. However, more research is needed to help inform tactical management decisions with the goal of climate-ready living marine resource management. This is a major challenge because the observed physical and biological changes are unprecedented, and the majority of marine species assessments and management decisions do not utilize environmental data. Here we review the research accomplishments and key needs for NOAA Fisheries in the U.S. NES in the context of climate change and living marine resource management. Key research needs and products are: 1) Infrastructure with continued and enhanced ocean surveys that includes cooperative research with the fishing industry and other NOAA line offices and partners; 2) Tracking and projecting change, and understanding mechanisms including state of the ecosystem reporting, improved regional ocean and ecosystem hindcasts, forecasts, and projections, and continued process-based laboratory and field studies, 3) climate-informed management, including stock assessments that account for climate where possible, translation of changing species distributions into spatial management, climate vulnerability assessment and scenario planning, ecosystem-based management, management strategy evaluations, and increased multidisciplinary science that includes economic and social indicators.},

  abstract = {Environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding has revolutionized biomonitoring in both marine and freshwater ecosystems. However, for semi-aquatic and terrestrial animals, the application of this technique remains relatively untested. We first assess the efficiency of eDNA metabarcoding in detecting semi-aquatic and terrestrial mammals in natural lotic ecosystems in the UK by comparing sequence data recovered from water and sediment samples to the mammalian communities expected from historical data. Secondly, using occupancy modelling we compared the detection efficiency of eDNA metabarcoding to multiple conventional non-invasive survey methods (latrine surveys and camera trapping). eDNA metabarcoding detected a large proportion of the expected mammalian community within each area. Common species in the areas were detected at the majority of sites. Several key species of conservation concern in the UK were detected by eDNA sampling in areas where authenticated records do not currently exist, but potential false positives were also identified. Water-based eDNA metabarcoding provided comparable results to conventional survey methods in per unit of survey effort for three species (water vole, field vole and red deer) using occupancy models. The comparison between survey ‘effort’ to reach a detection probability of ≥.95 revealed that 3–6 water replicates would be equivalent to 3–5 latrine surveys and 5–30~weeks of single camera deployment, depending on the species. Synthesis and applications. eDNA metabarcoding can be used to generate an initial ‘distribution map’ of mammalian diversity at the landscape level. If conducted during times of peak abundance, carefully chosen sampling points along multiple river courses provide a reliable snapshot of the species that are present in a catchment area. In order to fully capture solitary, rare and invasive species, we would currently recommend the use of eDNA metabarcoding alongside other non-invasive surveying methods (i.e. camera traps) to maximize monitoring efforts.},

Novel, rapid and cost-effective DNA-based approaches are valuable to improve understanding of the biological communities and for biomonitoring in remote areas. Here, we evaluate the potential of environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding for assessing the structure and distribution of fish communities by analysing water and sediment from 11 locations along the Jequitinhonha River catchment (Brazil). Each site was sampled twice, before and after a major rain event in a five-week period and fish diversity was estimated using high-throughput sequencing of 12S rRNA amplicons. In total, 252 Molecular Operational Taxonomic Units (MOTUs) and 34 fish species were recovered, including endemic, introduced, and previously unrecorded species for this basin. Spatio-temporal variation of eDNA from fish assemblages was observed and species richness was nearly twice as high before the major rain event compared to afterwards. Yet, peaks of diversity were primarily associated with only four of the locations. No correlation between β-diversity and longitudinal distance or presence of dams was detected, but low species richness observed at sites located near dams might that these anthropogenic barriers may have an impact on local fish diversity. Unexpectedly high α-diversity levels recorded at the river mouth suggest that these sections should be further evaluated as putative “eDNA reservoirs” for rapid monitoring. By uncovering spatio-temporal changes, unrecorded biodiversity components, and putative anthropogenic impacts on fish assemblages, we further strengthen the potential of eDNA metabarcoding as a biomonitoring tool, especially in regions often neglected or difficult to access.},

This contribution analyses the apparent convergence of dietary models worldwide with respect to the proportion of ABP and especially meat in intake. By using FAO data for 183 countries over the period 1961-2011, the authors show the connection between annual per capita GDP and the level of ABP (R2. =. 0.62) and meat consumption (R2. =. 0.62). They emphasise the surge in ABP intake in emerging countries (China, Brazil) which has partly replaced plant protein. However, for similar degrees of economic development, the composition of ABPs and the position of meat within this category vary significantly among countries, suggesting that historical, geographical, cultural and religious factors may be involved.},

  abstract = {While several studies point at off-shore aquaculture as a possible source of impacts on the local marine environment, very few have analysed its effects at large scales such as at the bay, gulf or basin levels. Similar analyses are hampered by the multiple sources of disturbance that may concomitantly affect a given area. The present paper addresses these issues taking the Gulf of Castellammare (Southern Tyrrhenian Sea) as an example. Nitrogen (N) and phosphorous (P) loads were calculated for the period 1970-2007, and compared to chlorophyll-a concentration as measured inside and outside the Gulf over the same period. Results indicate that N and P catchment loading has constantly decreased because of improved environmental management. Nevertheless, nutrient concentration in the Gulf has steadily increased since the establishment of aquaculture facilities in 1999. Chlorophyll-a concentration followed this trend, showing a marked increase from 2001 onwards. In the same period, chlorophyll-a concentrations measured inside and outside the Gulf have significantly diverged. As all the other possible causes can be ruled out, aquaculture remains the sole explanation for the observed situation. This paper demonstrates for the first time ever that off-shore aquaculture may affect the marine ecosystem well beyond the local scale and provides an additional element of concern to be kept into consideration when allocating oceans' space for new fish-farming activities. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

However, if eDNA testing is to become an increasingly reliable tool, high detection sensitivity is crucial. Current eDNA sampling methods, like filtration and precipitation, can only process small volumes of water per sample. If only a few samples are collected, eDNA from the target organism might be missed, leading to false-negative results. We developed an eDNA collection method for lentic systems that improved detection sensitivity while keeping the total number of samples low. Unlike filtration and precipitation, which mainly target extracellular DNA, this method specifically targets eDNA in larger particle sizes and is not limited to processing small volumes of water. A 64-micrometer mesh tow net was used to process {$>$}3,000~L of water per eDNA sample. We compared the tow net method to a common collection method, a 0.45~μm cellulose nitrate filter that processes about 1~L of water per eDNA sample. Paired tow and filter samples were collected at 37 locations and tested for two taxa: an aquatic plant, Northern watermilfoil (Myriophyllum sibiricum), and aquatic mollusks, including Helisoma anceps, using Kompetitive Allele Specific PCR (KASP) assays. We detected M.~sibiricum significantly more frequently in tow samples than filter samples. Mollusks were detected in all eDNA samples (tow nets and filters), but when eDNA samples were diluted 25-fold to mimic a low target concentration scenario, mollusk DNA was detected significantly more frequently in tow samples than filter samples. This high-volume eDNA sampling method, using a tow net to process thousands of liters of water, can improve detection sensitivity for multiple taxa, making it a useful tool for researchers and managers.},

These biodiversity shifts are recognized in marine ecosystems, but the underlying processes are barely understood so far. Importantly, human well-being highly relies on oceanic services, which are affected by anthropogenic pressures. Here, we review how interdisciplinary research approaches, with the incorporation of eDNA (environmental DNA) analyses, can help increase the understanding of complex ecosystem processes and dynamics, and how they affect ecosystem services. We discuss marine conservation issues in the light of life cycle aspects and conclude that eDNA can improve our ecological knowledge in some instances, for example, in tracking migration patterns. We also illustrate and discuss the application of eDNA analysis within the context of population genetics, epigenetics, geochemistry and oceanography. Embedded into an interdisciplinary context, eDNA can be exploited by a huge variety of methodological techniques, and can resolve spatio-temporal patterns of diversity, species, or even populations within ecological, evolutionary, and management frameworks.},

We created a new conceptual model to map the degree of human dependence on marine ecosystems based on the magnitude of the benefit, susceptibility of people to a loss of that benefit, and the availability of alternatives. We focused on mapping nutritional, economic, and coastal protection dependence, but our model is repeatable, scalable, applicable to other ecosystems, and designed to incorporate additional services and data. Here we show that dependence was highest for Pacific and Indian Ocean island nations and several West African countries. More than 775 million people live in areas with relatively high dependence scores. By identifying where and how people are dependent on marine ecosystems, our framework can be used to design more effective large‐scale management and policy interventions.},

  abstract = {Understanding the dietary preferences of endangered species can be useful in implementing conservation strategies, including habitat restoration, translocation, and captive breeding. Environmental DNA (eDNA) from feces provides a non-invasive method for analysing animal diets. Currently, metabarcoding, a PCR-based approach, is the method of choice for analysing such data. However, this method has limitations, specifically PCR bias, which can result in the overestimation of the importance of certain taxa and failure to detect other taxa because they do not amplify. The present study compared metabarcoding with metagenomics, a PCR-free method, to assess the diversity of prey items in the feces of a critically endangered South African estuarine pipefish,               Syngnathus watermeyeri               , and its widely distributed congener               S. temminckii               to investigate potential dietary competition. The metabarcoding results showed a distinct difference between the diets of               S. watermeyeri               and               S. temminckii               , with the former mainly consuming calanoid copepods and the latter preferring caridean shrimp. In each case, a single species dominated the sequences generated by metabarcoding. Metagenomics produced more species identifications, and although the same trend was found regarding the preference of               S. watermeyeri               for copepods and that of               S. temminckii               for shrimp, this approach identified additional, albeit yet unidentified, copepod species as being important in the diet of               S. watermeyeri               . We conclude that the lower number of species identified using metabarcoding was most likely a result of amplification bias, resulting in key copepod species missing from the dietary analysis. These findings suggest that metagenomics is not only a useful complementary method for molecular dietary analysis, but may in some cases outperform metabarcoding. However, metagenomics is even more strongly affected by the lack of reference sequences than is metabarcoding, as the majority of sequences originate from genomic regions that have not yet been sequenced for the putative prey species in question.},

In recent years, in vitro and in vivo assays provided new information concerning its mechanisms of action, thus a review dealing with propolis and the immune system became imperative. This review compiles data from our laboratory as well as from other researchers, focusing on its chemical composition and botanical sources, the seasonal effect on its composition and biological properties, its immunomodulatory and antitumor properties, considering its effects on antibody production and on different cells of the immune system, involving the innate and adaptive immune response. In vitro and in vivo assays demonstrated the modulatory action of propolis on murine peritoneal macrophages, increasing their microbicidal activity. Its stimulant action on the lytic activity of natural killer cells against tumor cells, and on antibody production was demonstrated. Propolis inhibitory effects on lymphoproliferation may be associated to its anti-inflammatory property. In immunological assays, the best results were observed when propolis was administered over a short-term to animals. Propolis antitumor property and its anticarcinogenic and antimutagenic potential are discussed. Since humans have used propolis for different purposes and propolis-containing products have been marketed, the knowledge of its properties with scientific basis is not only of academic interest but also of those who use propolis as well. This review opens a new perspective on the investigation of propolis biological properties, mainly with respect to the immune system. © 2007 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Therefore, detecting and monitoring harmful microalgal taxa is essential to ensure effective risk management in waterways used for fisheries, aquaculture, recreational activity, and shipping. To fully understand the current status and future direction of algal bloom distributions, we need to know how populations and ecosystems have changed over time. This baseline knowledge is critical for predicting ecosystem responses to future anthropogenic change and will assist in the future management of coastal ecosystems. We explore a NGS metabarcoding approach to rapidly identify potentially harmful microalgal taxa in 63 historic and modern Australian marine port and ballast tank sediment samples. The results provide a record of past microalgal distribution and important baseline data that can be used to assess the efficacy of shipping guidelines, nutrient pollution mitigation, and predict the impact of climate change. Critically, eDNA surveys of archived sediments were able to detect harmful algal taxa that do not produce microscopic fossils, such as               Chattonella, Heterosigma, Karlodinium,               and               Noctiluca               . Our data suggest a potential increase in Australian harmful microalgal taxa over the past 30~years, and confirm ship ballast tanks as key dispersal vectors. These molecular mapping tools will assist in the creation of policies aimed at reducing the global increase and spread of harmful algal taxa and help prevent economic and public‐health problems caused by harmful algal blooms.                        ,                             see also the Perspective by Epp},

It remains unclear whether eDNA signals can provide quantitative metrics of abundance on which human livelihoods or conservation successes depend.

We sampled eDNA in parallel with a traditional acoustic-trawl survey to assess the value of eDNA surveys at a scale relevant to fisheries management. Despite local differences, the two methods yield comparable information about the broad-scale spatial distribution and abundance. Furthermore, we find depth and spatial patterns of eDNA closely correspond to acoustic-trawl estimates for hake. We demonstrate the power and efficacy of eDNA sampling for estimating abundance and distribution and move the analysis eDNA data beyond sample-to-sample comparisons to management relevant scales. We posit that eDNA methods are capable of providing general quantitative applications that will prove especially valuable in data- or resource-limited contexts.},

At present, amplicon-sequencing studies—known also as metabarcoding studies, in which the primary data consist of targeted, amplified fragments of DNA sequenced from many taxa in a mixture—struggle to link genetic observations to the underlying biology in a quantitative way, but many applications require quantitative information about the taxa or systems under scrutiny. As metabarcoding studies proliferate in ecology, it becomes more important to develop ways to make them quantitative to ensure that their conclusions are adequately supported. Here we link previously disparate sets of techniques for making such data quantitative, showing that the underlying polymerase chain reaction mechanism explains the observed patterns of amplicon data in a general way. By modeling the process through which amplicon-sequence data arise, rather than transforming the data post hoc, we show how to estimate the starting DNA proportions from a mixture of many taxa. We illustrate how to calibrate the model using mock communities and apply the approach to simulated data and a series of empirical examples. Our approach opens the door to improve the use of metabarcoding data in a wide range of applications in ecology, public health, and related fields.},

  abstract = {Environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding is an increasingly popular tool for measuring and cataloguing biodiversity. Because the environments and substrates in which DNA is preserved differ considerably, eDNA research often requires bespoke approaches to generating eDNA data. Here, we explore how two experimental choices in eDNA study design—the number of PCR replicates and the depth of sequencing of PCR replicates—influence the composition and consistency of taxa recovered from eDNA extracts. We perform 24 PCR replicates from each of six soil samples using two of the most common metabarcodes for Fungi and Viridiplantae (ITS1 and ITS2), and sequence each replicate to an average depth of \textasciitilde 84,000 reads. We find that PCR replicates are broadly consistent in composition and relative abundance of dominant taxa, but that low abundance taxa are often unique to one or a few PCR replicates. Taxa observed in one out of 24 PCR replicates make up 21–29\% of the total taxa detected. We also observe that sequencing depth or rarefaction influences alpha diversity and beta diversity estimates. Read sampling depth influences local contribution to beta diversity, placement in ordinations, and beta dispersion in ordinations. Our results suggest that, because common taxa drive some alpha diversity estimates, few PCR replicates and low read sampling depths may be sufficient for many biological applications of eDNA metabarcoding. However, because rare taxa are recovered stochastically, eDNA metabarcoding may never fully recover the true amplifiable alpha diversity in an eDNA extract. Rare taxa drive PCR replicate outliers of alpha and beta diversity and lead to dispersion differences at different read sampling depths. We conclude that researchers should consider the complexity and unevenness of a community when choosing analytical approaches, read sampling depths, and filtering thresholds to arrive at stable estimates.},

To determine population counts, spatial or temporal frequencies, and age or weight distributions, snout to fork length measurements are captured from the video sequences, most commonly using a point and click process by a human operator. Current research aims to automate the measurement and counting task in order to improve the efficiency of the process and expand the use of stereo-video systems within marine science. A fully automated process will require the detection and identification of candidates for measurement, followed by the snout to fork length measurement, as well as the counting and tracking of fish.

Currently, eDNA approaches are used to detect specific fish species and determine fish community diversity. Various protocols used with eDNA methods for aquatic organism detection have been reported in different eDNA studies, but there are no general recommendations for fish detection. Herein, we reviewed 168 papers to supplement and highlight the key criteria for each step of eDNA technology in fish detection and provide general suggestions for eliminating detection errors. Although there is no unified recommendation for the application of diverse eDNA in detecting fish species, in most cases, 1 or 2 L surface water collection and eDNA capture on 0.7-μm glass fiber filters followed by extraction with a DNeasy Blood and Tissue Kit or PowerWater DNA Isolation Kit are useful for obtaining high-quality eDNA. Subsequently, species-specific quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) assays based on mitochondrial cytochrome b gene markers or eDNA metabarcoding based on both 12S and 16S rRNA markers via high-throughput sequencing can effectively detect target DNA or estimate species richness. Furthermore, detection errors can be minimized by mitigating contamination, negative control, PCR replication, and using multiple genetic markers. Our aim is to provide a useful strategy for fish eDNA technology that can be applied by researchers, advisors, and managers.},

The applied ecological indices include multi-metric eutrophication indices, a physicochemical status index applied for the first time in the Greek marine area, benthic indices, phytoplankton biomass index, and integrated status indices assessed through the application of the decision tree integration scheme. To investigate the exceedances in the eco-stoichiometric relationship between nutrients, considered a stressing factor, all physicochemical elements influenced directly or indirectly by eutrophication, such as nutrient concentrations, water transparency, oxygen saturation, particulates concentration, and sediment organic content, were related to ecological indices. Also, chemical contaminant stress factors represented by heavy metal concentrations in the water, as well as multiple stress factors represented by a pressure index, were related to ecological indices. A graphical visualization multivariate tool and statistical correlations were used to evaluate the sensitivity or explanatory power of the tested ecological indices against single and multiple stress factors. Results showed a strong response of all ecological indices to stress factors, although a diversification of sensitivity was evident. Primary production-related indices, i.e., macroalgae and chlorophyll-a indices, are more sensitive to particulates and nitrogen, while secondary production-related indices, i.e., benthic macroinvertebrates indices and eutrophication indices, including nutrients, are more sensitive to phosphates in the water column. The macroalgae index shows the strongest sensitivity to multiple stress factors. Among metals, mostly cadmium seems to match all indices' performance. Nutrient relationships were shown as critical to eutrophication and ecological status.},

  abstract = {A paper recently published by               Phillips et al. (1996)               reported a molecular genetic study of all recognized subspecies of the common snapping turtle ({$\quad$}Chelydra serpentina) and concluded from patterns of geographic variation in isozyme and mitochondrial DNA restriction fragment pattern data that three evolutionary species should be recognized in this group. We suggest that this paper is fundamentally flawed because it fails to present any species concept as a testable hypothesis. Data are collected in the absence of any conceptual framework for diagnosing species boundaries, so no criteria for acceptance or rejection of a preferred hypothesis are formulated, and species boundaries are determined in a nonrigorous, post hoc manner. Further, the absence of specific criteria for species diagnosis in this case leads to flaws in sampling design, data collection, and data analysis. Because these design flaws are typical of many studies, we briefly outline three different lineage‐based operational species concepts (phylogenetic, concordance, and cohesion) and present an alternative interpretation of the Chelydra data, insofar as this is possible given the design limitations. We conclude the following: (1) species status may not be warranted for the Central and South American taxa, (2) more‐detailed analysis is warranted in the U.S. population because distinct lineage may be obscured by poor lab technique or introgression of mtDNA, and (3) the Ecuadorean population may deserve species status based on fixed nuclear isozyme loci. We recommend the following procedures for implementation of lineage‐based species concepts within a rigorous hypothesis testing framework. First, if an animal is to be sacrificed, proper care should be taken to utilize different tissues for multiple pass electrophoresis. This will unmask hidden heterogeneity and maximize the number of resolved loci. Second, when phylogenetic relationships are reconstructed with restriction fragment length polymorphism data, fragment data should be converted to site data to avoid uncertainties in homology. Finally, a proper sampling scheme should be designed to address the question of species status in terms of numbers of individuals, genetic loci, populations, and geographic regions.                          Comprobar Demarcaciones de Especies en Investigaciones de Biodiversidad                            Un artículo publicado recientemente por               Phillips et al. (1996)               , reportó un estudio acerca de la genética molecular en todos las subespecies reconocidos de la tortuga común ({$\quad$}Chelydra serpentina). Se concluyó, con base en los patrones de variación geográfica en isoenzimas y en fragmentos de restricción de ADN mitocondrial, que tres especies evolutivas deberían ser reconocidas en este grupo. Nosotros sugerimos que ese artículo está mal fundamentado porque no presenta un concepto de especie como hipótesis a probar. Por consiguiente, los datos son obtenidos en ausencia de un marco conceptual para diagnosticar límites de especies. Esto es, que no se formula un criterio para la aceptación o rechazo de una hipótesis adoptada y los límites de especie son determinados de una manera post hoc y no rigurosa. Además, la ausencia de criterios específicos para la diagnosis de especies, en este caso, lleva a un inadecuado diseño de muestreo, obtención de datos y análisis de los mismos. Debido a que estos diseños inadecuados son típicos en muchos estudios, nosotros damos brevemente los lineamientos de tres diferentes conceptos operacionales de especie basados en linajes ({$\quad$}filogenético, de concordancia y de cohesión) y presentamos una interpretación alternativa para los datos de Cheyldra, hasta donde es posible, dadas las limitaciones del diseño. Concluimos lo siguiente: (1) el estatus de especie puede no ser garantizado para los taxa de Centro y Suramérica, (2) un análisis más detallado es requerido en las poblaciones de U.S. ya que técnicas deficientes de laboratorio o la introgresión de mtADN pueden dificultar la distinción de linajes, y (3) las poblaciones ecuatorianas podrían recibir el estatus de especie con base en loci fijados de isoemzimas nucleares. Recomendamos lo siguiente para la implementación de conceptos de especie basados en linajes dentro de un riguroso marco de hipótesis a probar. Primero, si un animal va a ser sacrificado, se debe asegurar el uso de diferentes tejidos para múltiples corridas de electroforesis. Esto descubrirá heterogeneidad escondida y maximizará el número de loci resueltos. Segundo, al construir las relaciones filogenéticas con datos de polimorfismos en longitud de fragmentos de restricción, se debería de convertir los datos de fragmentos en datos de sitios para evitar dudas en la homología. Finalmente, se debería diseñar un apropiado esquema de muestreo para abordar la pregunta del estatus de especie en términos de número de individuos, loci genéticos, poblaciones y regiones geográficas.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Temporal variability in abundance and composition of species in marine ecosystems results from a combination of internal processes, external drivers, and stochasticity. One way to explore the temporal variability in an ecosystem is through temporal stability, measured using the inverse of the coefficient of variation for biomass of single species. The effect of temperature and fisheries on the variability of the Barents Sea food web is still poorly understood. To address this question, we simulate the possible dynamics of Barents Sea food web under different temperature and fishery scenarios using a simple food‐web model (Non‐Deterministic Network Dynamic [NDND]). The NDND model, which is based on chance and necessity (CaN), defines the state space of the ecosystem using its structural constraints (necessity) and explores it stochastically (chance). The effects of temperature and fisheries on stability are explored both separately and combined. The simulation results suggest that increasing temperature has a negative effect on species biomass and increasing fisheries triggers compensatory dynamics of fish species. There is a major intra‐scenario variability in temporal stability, while individual scenarios of temperature and fisheries display a weak negative impact and no effect on stability, respectively. However, combined scenarios indicate that fisheries amplify the effects of temperature on stability, while increasing temperature leads to a shift from synergistic to antagonistic effects between these two drivers.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Studies of geographical patterns of diversity have focused largely on compiling and analysing data to evaluate alternative hypotheses for the near‐universal decrease in species richness from the equator to the poles. Valuable insights into the mechanisms that promote diversity can come from studies of other patterns, such as variation in species distributions with elevation in terrestrial systems or with depth in marine systems. To obtain such insights, we analysed and interpreted data on species diversity, depth of occurrence and body size of pelagic fishes along an oceanic depth gradient. We used a database on pelagic marine fishes native to the north‐east Pacific Ocean between 40°N and 50°N. We used data from the Pacific Rim Fisheries Program that were obtained from commercial, management and scientific surveys between 1999 and 2000. Depth of occurrence and maximum body length were used to assess the distributions of 409 species of pelagic fishes along a depth gradient from 0 to 8000~m. A presence–absence matrix was used to classify the depth range of each species into 100‐m intervals.               Atmar \& Patterson's (1995               ) software was used to quantify the degree of nestedness of species distributions. Pelagic fish species diversity decreased steeply with increasing depth; diversity peaked at less than 200 m and more than half of the species had mean depths of occurrence between 0 and 300~m. The distribution of species showed a very strong nested subset pattern along the depth gradient. Whereas species with narrow ranges were generally restricted to shallow waters, wide‐ranging species occurred from near the surface to great depths. The relationship between maximum body size and mean depth range differed between teleost and elasmobranch fishes: being positive for teleosts, but negative for elasmobranches. Results support hypotheses that some combination of high productivity and warm temperature promote high species diversity, and reject those that would attribute the pattern of species richness to the mid‐domain effect, habitat area, or environmental constancy. The data provided a clear example of Rapoport's rule, a negative correlation between average depth range and species diversity.},

  abstract = {The impact of salmon farming on the environment has been widely studied; there is, however, no consensus on the magnitude and quality of these effects and little information on their extent over large salmon farming areas. Forty-three salmon farm sites of which 29 are in full operation and grouped in nine locations in southern Chile were evaluated. Using statistical methods (two-way ANOVA), no effects were found on water column variables such as nitrate, ammonia, orthophosphate and chlorophyll, whereas they were significant on sediment variables such as nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and organic carbon (OC), among others. Natural variability evaluation of some parameters revealed that P in sediments had the lowest coefficient of variation (23.2\%) when compared with N (65.2\%), particulate organic matter (POM) (139\%) and OC (39\%), and showed more marked salmon farming effects with no locality effects. Four of the nine locations showed stronger effects on sediments, with average P values ranging from 150 to 230 mmol that were six to nine times higher than in control sites (25 mmol). Nitrogen and carbon in sediments, while showing significant effects on salmon farming, also showed locality effects that revealed other biogenic processes influencing sediment composition. Thus, P in sediments was proposed as a promising indicator of impact on salmon farming, although the relationship with fauna in sediments was not linear and somewhat variable; more research is therefore needed to understand such connections. Considering entire geographical locations, no relationship was found between sediment conditions under salmon cages and the condition of the water column at a farm. This may indicate the possibility of high dilution rates and recycling processes, which so far preclude the detection of more global impacts beyond the cages shadow. © 2004 Blackwell Verlag, Berlin.},

  abstract = {In order to evaluate the present distribution patterns of salmonids and their potential effects on native fish, we sampled 11 large lakes and 105 streams, encompassing a total of 13 main hydrographic watersheds of southern Chile (39° to 52°S). Overall, trout (Salmo trutta and Oncorhynchus mykiss) accounted for more than 60 \% of total fish abundance and more than 80 \% of total biomass, while 40 \% of the streams sampled did not have native fish. Salmon, introduced for aquaculture, such as O. kisutch, Salmo salar, and O. tshawytscha, were only present in lakes with salmon farming and did not seem to be reproducing naturally in affluent streams. We tested the effect of river geographic origin (Andes mountains, central valley, or Coastal range) on fish abundance and found that rainbow trout was more restricted to the Andean streams with higher water discharge, while brown trout was widely distributed and did not relate to any of several catchment attributes measured. The abundance of native fish was greater in lakes than in streams and the highest native fish biodiversity occurred in streams of the central valley. The most common native species were Galaxias maculatus, G. platei, Brachygalaxias bullocki, Aplochiton zebra and Basilichthys australis. Streams with higher conductivity, larger pool areas, more fine sediments, and low brown trout densities were more suitable for native fish. Thus, catchments with higher anthropogenic disturbance appeared as refuges for native species. Given the descriptive nature of our study we can only presume the negative impacts of trout and salmon on native fish; an effect which should be superimposed on biogeographical conditioning of present distribution. Yet based on the present abundance and distribution patterns of salmonids and native fish, negative effects are very likely. Conservation of native fish biodiversity in central valley streams, far from protected areas or national parks and fully exposed to human perturbations represents a great challenge. We propose to enhance conservation by exerting a stronger sport fishing pressure on trout in those streams. © 2006 Sociedad de Biología de Chile.},

  abstract = {Abstract Estimating the abundance of organisms is fundamental to the study and management of ecological systems. However, accurately and precisely estimating organism abundance is challenging, especially in aquatic systems where organisms are hidden underwater. Estimating the abundance of fish is critical for the management of fisheries which relies on accurate assessment of population status to maximize yield without overharvesting populations. Monitoring population status is particularly challenging for inland fisheries in which populations are distributed among many individual waterbodies. Environmental DNA (eDNA) may offer a cost-effective way to rapidly estimate populations across a large number of systems if eDNA quantity correlates with the abundance of its source organisms. Here, we test the ability of quantities of eDNA recovered from surface water to estimate the abundance of walleye (Sander vitreus), a culturally and economically important sportfish, in lakes in northern Wisconsin (USA). We demonstrate a significant, positive relationship between traditional estimates of adult walleye populations (both number of individuals and biomass) and eDNA concentration (R2 = .81; n = 22). Our results highlight the utility of eDNA as a population monitoring tool that can help guide and inform inland fisheries management.},

  abstract = {The number of species of Bacteria and Archaea (               ca               5000) is surprisingly small considering their early evolution, genetic diversity and residence in all ecosystems. The bacterial species definition accounts in part for the small number of named species. The primary procedures required to identify new species of Bacteria and Archaea are DNA–DNA hybridization and phenotypic characterization. Recently, 16S rRNA gene sequencing and phylogenetic analysis have been applied to bacterial taxonomy. Although 16S phylogeny is arguably excellent for classification of Bacteria and Archaea from the Domain level down to the family or genus, it lacks resolution below that level. Newer approaches, including multilocus sequence analysis, and genome sequence and microarray analyses, promise to provide necessary information to better understand bacterial speciation. Indeed, recent data using these approaches, while meagre, support the view that speciation processes may occur at the subspecies level within ecological niches (ecovars) and owing to biogeography (geovars). A major dilemma for bacterial taxonomists is how to incorporate this new information into the present hierarchical system for classification of Bacteria and Archaea without causing undesirable confusion and contention. This author proposes the genomic–phylogenetic species concept (GPSC) for the taxonomy of prokaryotes. The aim is twofold. First, the GPSC would provide a conceptual and testable framework for bacterial taxonomy. Second, the GPSC would replace the burdensome requirement for DNA hybridization presently needed to describe new species. Furthermore, the GPSC is consistent with the present treatment at higher taxonomic levels.},

  abstract = {Effective marine management requires comprehensive data on the status of marine biodiversity. However, efficient methods that can document biodiversity in our oceans are currently lacking. Environmental DNA (eDNA) sourced from seawater offers a new avenue for investigating the biota in marine ecosystems. Here, we investigated the potential of eDNA to inform on the breadth of biodiversity present in a tropical marine environment. Directly sequencing eDNA from seawater using a shotgun approach resulted in only 0.34\% of 22.3 million reads assigning to eukaryotes, highlighting the inefficiency of this method for assessing eukaryotic diversity. In contrast, using 'tree of life' (ToL) metabarcoding and 20-fold fewer sequencing reads, we could detect 287 families across the major divisions of eukaryotes. Our data also show that the best performing 'universal' PCR assay recovered only 44\% of the eukaryotes identified across all assays, highlighting the need for multiple metabarcoding assays to catalogue biodiversity. Lastly, focusing on the fish genus Lethrinus, we recovered intra- and inter-specific haplotypes from seawater samples, illustrating that eDNA can be used to explore diversity beyond taxon identifications. Given the sensitivity and low cost of eDNA metabarcoding we advocate this approach be rapidly integrated into biomonitoring programs.},

  abstract = {Monitoring communities of fish is important for the management and sustainability of fisheries and marine ecosystems. Baited remote underwater video systems (BRUVs) are among the most effective nondestructive techniques for sampling bony fishes and elasmobranchs (sharks, rays, and skates). However, BRUVs sample visually conspicuous biota; hence, some taxa are undersampled or not recorded at all. We compared the diversity of fishes characterized using BRUVs with diversity detected via environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding. We sampled seawater and captured BRUVs imagery at 48 locales that included reef and seagrass beds inside and outside a marine reserve (Jurien Bay in Western Australia). Eighty-two fish genera from 13 orders were detected, and the community of fishes described using eDNA and BRUVs combined yielded {$>$}30\% more generic richness than when either method was used alone. Rather than detecting a homogenous genetic signature, the eDNA assemblages mirrored the BRUVs’ spatial explicitness; differentiation of taxa between seagrass and reef was clear despite the relatively small geographical scale of the study site (∼35 km 2 ). Taxa that were not sampled by one approach, due to limitations and biases intrinsic to the method, were often detected with the other. Therefore, using BRUVs and eDNA in concert provides a more holistic view of vertebrate marine communities across habitats. Both methods are noninvasive, which enhances their potential for widespread implementation in the surveillance of marine ecosystems.},

  abstract = {A model has been developed for estimating the holding capacity of sites for fish farming. Expressed in terms of maximum fish production per month, the holding capacity is estimated with regard to three basic environmental requirements:(i) the benthic fauna at a farm site must not be allowed to disappear due to accumulation of organic material;(ii) the water quality in the net pens must be kept high;(iii) the water quality in the areas surrounding the farm must not deteriorate.All these requirements must be fulfilled, and the holding capacity is determined by the lowest of the three estimates. The fulfillment of requirements (i) and (ii) depends on local environmental properties such as water depth, the annual temperature cycle and the vertical distribution of current properties, and concentrations of oxygen and ammonium. It also depends on the maximum fish density per unit area, so the physical configuration of the farm is of importance. All these factors as well as feeding rate and feed composition are taken into account in the model. The model comprises four sub-models which, for a given set of local environmental parameters, compute holding capacity according to these basic requirements. Given the feeding rate, feed composition and water temperature, a general fish sub-model adapted for domesticated Atlantic salmon computes the metabolism, growth and feed requirement of a specified fish stock. The fish model also computes emissions of particulate organic matter, i.e., uneaten feed and faeces. A dispersion sub-model computes the distribution of particulate matter from the net pens on the bottom for various sizes of pens and distances between them. A benthic sub-model computes the maximum rate of particulate matter sedimentation that will not result in the extinction of the benthic macro infauna. Water quality in the net pens is expressed as the lowest concentration of oxygen and the highest concentration of dissolved substances potentially harmful to the fish. These are computed by the water quality sub-model that needs input from the fish sub-model concerning the emission of dissolved substances and the consumption of oxygen due to respiration. The holding capacity according to requirement (iii) is computed by means of a previously published model. © 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Using the fan mussel,                 Atrina fragilis                 (Pennant 1777), as our case species, the aim of the study was to predict new areas of occurrence for                 A.~fragilis                 , estimate the extent of potentially suitable areas, determine the proportion of these areas that are included in the recently designated nature conservation                 MPA                 s off the west of Scotland and identify possible environmental drivers in the distribution of                 A.~fragilis                 .

Methods               Using a point process framework, we modelled presence‐only data, including historic records. A quadrat survey employing digital still photography was conducted in areas of high and low suitability to verify the model, and subsequently, a targeted survey was undertaken in areas predicted as highly suitable by the models using towed video cameras.                                         Results                                Five environmental variables were of prime importance in explaining the distribution of                 A.~fragilis                 . The results from the verification survey support model performance.                 Atrina fragilis                 was found in 80\% of the targeted transects undertaken. Approximately 14\% of the total area predicted as suitable for                 A.~fragilis                 occurred within recently designated marine protected areas (                 MPA                 s) indicating considerable potential for recolonization given suitable protection.                                                        Main conclusions                                The verified model suggests that limited presence‐only and historical records of rare species can perform well within a                 SDM                 framework allowing the identification of further suitable areas. The prominence of bathymetric ruggedness in the models is unexpected, given the understood ecological niche for                 A.~fragilis                 and pinnids in general, but is consistent with the fact that seabed topography can offer protection from fishing pressure. These results will inform restoration objectives of the                 MPA                 network.},

Sediment samples (n = 72) were collected from below salmon cages towards distant reference sites. Bacterial community profiles inferred from DNA metabarcodes were compared to reference data from standard macrofauna biomonitoring surveys of the same samples. Deltaproteobacteria were predominant in immediate vicinity of the salmon cages. Along the transect, significant shifts in bacterial community structures were observed with Gammaproteobacteria dominating the less-impacted sites. Alpha- and beta-diversity measures of bacterial communities correlated significantly with macrofauna diversity metrics and with five ecological status indices. Benthic bacterial communities mirror the reaction of macrofauna bioindicators to environmental disturbances caused by salmon farming. The implementation of bacterial eDNA metabarcoding in future Strategic Framework Directives is an alternative cost-effective high-throughput biomonitoring solution, providing a basis for management strategies in a matter of days rather than months.},

Realizing this promise awaits better understanding of how eDNA relates to fish presence and abundance. Here, we evaluate performance by comparing bottom trawl catches to eDNA from concurrent water samples. In conjunction with New Jersey Ocean Trawl Survey, 1-l water samples were collected at surface and depth prior to tows at about one-fourth of Survey sites in January, June, August, and November 2019. eDNA fish diversity from 1 l was same as or higher than trawl fish diversity from 66\,M litres swept by one tow. Most (70–87\%) species detected by trawl in a given month were also detected by eDNA, and vice versa, including nearly all (92–100\%) abundant species. Trawl and eDNA peak seasonal abundance agreed for ∼70\% of fish species. In log-scale comparisons by month, eDNA species reads correlated with species biomass, and more strongly with an allometric index calculated from biomass. In this 1-year study, eDNA reporting largely concorded with monthly trawl estimates of marine fish species richness, composition, seasonality, and relative abundance. Piggybacking eDNA onto an existing survey provided a relatively low-cost approach to better understand eDNA for marine fish stock assessment.},

However, the extent to which current methods optimize fish eDNA detection from water samples is unknown. Here, we test modifications to laboratory components of an eDNA metabarcoding protocol targeting marine finfish. As compared to baseline methods, amplifying a smaller proportion of extracted DNA yielded fewer species, and, conversely, amplifying a larger proportion identified more taxa. Higher-read species were amplified more reproducibly and with less variation in read number than were lower-read species. Among pooled samples, 20-fold deeper sequencing recovered one additional fish species out of a total of 63 species. No benefit was observed with additional PCR cycles, alternative primer concentrations, or fish-selective primers. Experiments using an exogenous DNA standard to assess absolute eDNA concentration suggested that, for a given proportion of a DNA sample, current laboratory methods for metabarcoding marine fish eDNA are near to maximally sensitive. Our results support the unofficial standard collection volume of one liter for eDNA assessment of commonly encountered marine fish species. We conclude that eDNA rarity poses the main challenge to current methods.},

  abstract = {Effective ocean management asks for up-to-date knowledge of marine biogeography. Here we compare eDNA and gear-based assessments of marine fish populations using an approach that focuses on the commonest species. The protocol takes advantage of the “hollow curve” of species abundance distributions, with a minority of species comprising the great majority of individuals or biomass. We analyzed new and published teleost eDNA metabarcoding surveys from three neighboring northwest Atlantic coastal locations representing sandy, rocky, or estuary habitat. Fish eDNA followed a hollow curve species abundance distribution at each location—the 10 commonest taxa accounted for more than 90\% of eDNA copies. Top ten taxa were designated eDNA-dominant species (eDDS) and categorized as habitat-associated (top 10 in one study) or as shared. eDDS by category were similarly abundant in concurrent bottom trawl and seine surveys. eDDS habitat category profiles correctly classified most (94\%-100\%) individual eDNA and capture measurements within surveys and recognized estuarine sites in other regional eDNA and seine studies. Using a category metric like that for habitats, eDDS demonstrated strong seasonal turnover concordant with trawl catch weights. eDNA seasonal profiles applied to historical trawl and seine records highlighted known long-term trends in mid-Atlantic fish populations. This study provides evidence that eDNA-abundant fish species differ among coastal habitats and by season consistent with gear-based assessments. Grouping abundant species by category facilitated comparisons among habitats and integration with established surveys. eDNA metabarcoding of dominant fish species potentially offers a useful tool for marine biogeography and ocean monitoring.},

To better understand the environmental drivers of eDNA degradation, we conducted a laboratory experiment to quantify degradation rates. We held bullfrog (Lithobates catesbeianus) tadpoles in microcosms, then removed the tadpoles and assigned the microcosms to three levels each of temperature, ultraviolet B (UV-B) radiation, and pH in a full factorial design. We collected water samples from each microcosm at six time steps (0 to 58. days). In all microcosms, most degradation occurred in the first three to 10. days of the experiment, but eDNA remained detectable after 58. days in some treatments. Degradation rates were lowest under cold temperatures (5. °C), low UV-B levels, and alkaline conditions. Higher degradation rates were associated with factors that contribute to favorable environments for microbial growth (higher temperatures, neutral pH, moderately high UV-B), indicating that the effects of these factors may be biologically mediated. The results of this experiment indicate that aquatic habitats that are colder, more protected from solar radiation, and more alkaline are likely to hold detectable amounts of eDNA longer than those that are warmer, sunnier, and neutral or acidic. These results can be used to facilitate better characterization of environmental conditions that reduce eDNA persistence, improved design of temporal sampling intervals and inference, and more robust detection of aquatic species with eDNA methods.},

  abstract = {We present a whole-body aquatic food web bioaccumulation model for perfluoroalkyl acids and two alternatives. Results highlight structure-dependent mechanisms, including phospholipid partitioning, blood plasma protein binding, and renal elimination.           ,                             Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are a large class of highly fluorinated anthropogenic chemicals. Some PFAS bioaccumulate in aquatic food webs, thereby posing risks for seafood consumers. Existing models for persistent organic pollutants (POPs) perform poorly for ionizable PFAS. Here we adapt a well-established food web bioaccumulation model for neutral POPs to predict the bioaccumulation behavior of six perfluoroalkyl acids (PFAAs) and two perfluoroalkyl ether acids (HFPO-DA, 9-Cl-PF3ONS) produced as PFAA replacements. The new model includes sorption to blood plasma proteins and phospholipids, empirically parameterized membrane transport, and renal elimination for PFAAs. Improved performance relative to prior models without these updates is shown by comparing simulations to field and lab measurements. PFAS with eight or more perfluorinated carbons (               η               pfc               ≥ 8,               i.e.               , C8 perfluorosulfonic acid, C10–C11 perfluorocarboxylic acid, 9-Cl-PF3ONS) are often the most abundant in aquatic food webs. The new model reproduces their observed bioaccumulation potential within a factor of two for {$>$}80\% of fish species, indicating its readiness to support development of fish consumption advisories for these compounds. Results suggest bioaccumulation of               η               pfc               ≥ 8 PFAS is primarily driven by phospholipid partitioning, and that renal elimination is negligible for these compounds. However, specific protein binding mechanisms are important for reproducing the observed tissue concentrations of many shorter-chain PFAAs, including protein transporter-mediated renal elimination. Additional data on protein-binding and membrane transport mechanisms for PFAS are needed to better understand the biological behavior of shorter-chain PFAAs and their alternatives.},

  abstract = {Understanding the movement of genes and individuals across marine seascapes is a long-standing challenge in marine ecology and can inform our understanding of local adaptation, the persistence and movement of populations, and the spatial scale of effective management. Patterns of gene flow in the ocean are often inferred based on population genetic analyses coupled with knowledge of species' dispersive life histories. However, genetic structure is the result of time-integrated processes and may not capture present-day connectivity between populations. Here, we use a high-resolution oceanographic circulation model to predict larval dispersal along the complex coastline of western Canada that includes the transition between two well-studied zoogeographic provinces. We simulate dispersal in a benthic sea star with a 6-10 week pelagic larval phase and test predictions of this model against previously observed genetic structure including a strong phylogeographic break within the zoogeographical transition zone. We also test predictions with new genetic sampling in a site within the phylogeographic break. We find that the coupled genetic and circulation model predicts the high degree of genetic structure observed in this species, despite its long pelagic duration. High genetic structure on this complex coastline can thus be explained through ocean circulation patterns, which tend to retain passive larvae within 20-50 km of their parents, suggesting a necessity for close-knit design of Marine Protected Area networks.},

Environmental DNA (eDNA)‐based monitoring could complement conventional krill surveys, but its applicability is limited by a lack of knowledge on eDNA persistence and decay in the Southern Ocean. We aimed to develop a method that can not only quantify Antarctic krill eDNA, but also estimate a relative time since this eDNA was shed (“recent” vs “older”). Three species‐specific qPCR markers targeting the mitochondrial 16S region were developed, and the eDNA decay characteristics of these markers were determined through tank experiments. Krill eDNA was partially degraded in all samples, even when krill were present. Marker concentrations decreased exponentially at similar rates after krill removal, with initial relative abundances maintained across the three markers. Over time, the concentration of the longest marker decreased faster, changing the relative abundances of the markers, and allowing discrimination of more recent samples from more degraded older samples. We employed this new method to quantify Antarctic krill eDNA collected across a 4800\,km Southern Ocean transect, and estimated the age of the eDNA in these samples based on the relative abundance of markers, adding a temporal aspect to a quantitative eDNA survey. We also compared a Euphausiid‐specific metabarcoding marker to the qPCR method to assess sensitivity in detecting Antarctic krill eDNA. While these new eDNA methods should be evaluated against existing non‐molecular survey methods, they could add an important novel, dynamic layer of information to future krill surveys. Our method could not only determine where Antarctic krill eDNA is present but shed light on how they may be using certain habitats, expanding our understanding of this important species’ life cycle and contributing to more accurate abundance and distribution estimates.},

  abstract = {Fish aquaculture potentially affects the local ecosystem through feed (leftovers) and feces. However, evaluation of its impacts on biodiversity, especially those of mobile organisms such as fish, is not straightforward. Here, we report a case study in which environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding with MiFish universal primers for the 12S rRNA region of fish is used to detect and assess the impact of aquaculture on local fish communities. In Shizugawa Bay, Minamisanriku Town, Miyagi Prefecture, Japan, Oncorhynchus kisutch (coho salmon) is aquacultured in sea cages from November to July, but is absent from August to October. We conducted eDNA surveys in June, August, October, and December 2021 of water at depths of 5 m and 1 m above the bottom obtained from two sites, one approximately 100 m and the other approximately 2500 m from the nearest aquaculture site. The total number of operational taxonomic units (OTUs) detected was 122, with a maximum of 50 and a minimum of 10. With distance-based redundancy analysis (dbRDA) and PERMANOVA applied to the eDNA-based community compositional data, we detected a significant effect of the presence of O. kisutch aquaculture on fish biodiversity. The generalized linear model (GLM) applied to each detected OTUs indicated that the aquaculture was associated positively with Leucopsarion petersii (ice goby), and Oncorhynchus spp. and negatively with Chaenogobius annularis (forktongue goby). Environmental DNA metabarcoding surveys, combined with multivariate statics, are a promising tool to identify the dimension of biodiversity that human activity affects and would serve as a basic survey for sustainable use of the sea.},

We construct a 45-year record of nitrogen stable isotopes measured in larvae of Northern Anchovy (               Engraulis mordax               ) in the California Current Ecosystem to assess patterns in food chain length. Larval trophic efficiency associated with a shortened food chain increased larval survival and produced boom periods of high adult biomass. In contrast, when larval food chain length increased, and energy transfer efficiency decreased, the population crashed. We propose the Trophic Efficiency in Early Life (TEEL) hypothesis, which states that larval fishes must consume prey that confer sufficient energy for survival, to help explain natural boom-bust dynamics of coastal pelagic fishes. Our findings illustrate a potential for trophic indicators to generally inform larval survival and adult population dynamics of coastal-pelagic fishes.},

  abstract = {Environmental DNA (eDNA) from aquatic vertebrates has recently been used to estimate the presence of a species. We hypothesized that fish release DNA into the water at a rate commensurate with their biomass. Thus, the concentration of eDNA of a target species may be used to estimate the species biomass. We developed an eDNA method to estimate the biomass of common carp (Cyprinus carpio L.) using laboratory and field experiments. In the aquarium, the concentration of eDNA changed initially, but reached an equilibrium after 6 days. Temperature had no effect on eDNA concentrations in aquaria. The concentration of eDNA was positively correlated with carp biomass in both aquaria and experimental ponds. We used this method to estimate the biomass and distribution of carp in a natural freshwater lagoon. We demonstrated that the distribution of carp eDNA concentration was explained by water temperature. Our results suggest that biomass data estimated from eDNA concentration reflects the potential distribution of common carp in the natural environment. Measuring eDNA concentration offers a non-invasive, simple, and rapid method for estimating biomass. This method could inform management plans for the conservation of ecosystems. © 2012 Takahara et al.},

Both methods showed a high degree of linearity and quantitative correlation. However, ddPCR assays generated more reproducible results and detected lower copy numbers than qPCR assays.

  abstract = {Norwegian aquaculture has grownfrom its pioneering days in the 1970s to be a major industry. It is primarily based on culturing Atlantic salmon and rainbow trout and has the potential to influence the surrounding environment and wild populations. To evaluate these potential hazards, the Institute of Marine Research initiated a risk assessment of Norwegian salmon farming in 2011. This assessment has been repeated annually since. Here, we describe the background, methods and limitations of the risk assessment for the following hazards: genetic introgression of farmed salmon in wild populations, regulatory effects of salmon lice and viral diseases on wild salmonid populations, local and regional impact of nutrients and organic load. The main findings are as follows: (i) 21 of the 34 wild salmon populations investigated indicated moderate-tohigh risk for genetic introgression from farmed escaped salmon. (ii) of 109 stations investigated along the Norwegian coast for salmon lice infection, 27 indicated moderate-to-high likelihood of mortality for salmon smolts while 67 stations indicated moderate-to-high mortality of wild sea trout. (iii) Viral disease outbreaks (pancreas disease, infectious pancreatic necrosis, heart and skeletal muscle inflammation, and cardiomyopathy syndrome) in Norwegian salmon farming suggest extensive release of viruses in many areas. However, screening of wild salmonids revealed low to very low prevalence of the causal viruses. (iv) From  500 yearly investigations of local organic loading under fish farms, only 2\% of them displayed unacceptable conditions in 2013. The risk of eutrophication and organic load beyond the production area of the farm is considered low. Despite several limitations, especially limited monitoring data, this work represents one of the world’s first risk assessment of aquaculture. This has provided the Norwegian government with the basis upon which to take decisions for further development of the Norwegian aquaculture industry.},

  abstract = {The agricultural world today is dominated by a few domesticated mammal species, that is, animals modified from their wild ancestors through selective breeding in captivity for traits beneficial to human usages. As a result, a clear dichotomy exists between wild (from hunting) and domesticated mammals (produced in farms) used for human consumption. Similar to agriculture, aquaculture is often viewed as the only solution that can provide more fish products given that harvesting wild stocks have reached an upper limit. Aquaculture is considerably younger than agriculture relying on natural sources to farm numerous species. To better describe the diverse strategies for fish production, we propose a new classification comprising five levels of 'domestication' with 1 being the least to 5 being the most domesticated. Our classification places 70\% of the 250 farmed finfish species recorded in the 2009 FAO database into levels 1, 2 and 3 representing a transitory form of fish production dependent on the availability of the wild resource. In contrast, only a few species, or more accurately populations, can be considered truly domesticated, similar to cattle or sheep. Based on this classification, two scenarios for the future of aquaculture are discussed: either the industry focuses on few truly domesticated species, similar to the path taken by agriculture, but avoiding its negative impacts or aquaculture proceeds with inter-specific diversification by focusing primarily on the domestication of native species. © 2012 John Wiley \& Sons Ltd.},

  abstract = {The use of environmental DNA (eDNA) analysis for species monitoring requires rigorous validation—from field sampling to the analysis of PCR-based results—for meaningful application and interpretation. Assays targeting eDNA released by individual species are typically validated with no predefined criteria to answer specific research questions in one ecosystem. Hence, the general applicability of assays, as well as associated uncertainties and limitations, often remain undetermined. The absence of clear guidelines for assay validation prevents targeted eDNA assays from being incorporated into species monitoring and policy; thus, their establishment is essential for realizing the potential of eDNA-based surveys. We describe the measures and tests necessary for successful validation of targeted eDNA assays and the associated pitfalls to form the basis of guidelines. A list of 122 variables was compiled, consolidated into 14 thematic blocks (e.g., “in silico analysis”), and arranged on a 5-level validation scale from “incomplete” to “operational” with defined minimum validation criteria for each level. These variables were evaluated for 546 published single-species assays. The resulting dataset was used to provide an overview of current validation practices and test the applicability of the validation scale for future assay rating. Of the 122 variables, 20\% to 76\% were reported; the majority (30\%) of investigated assays were classified as Level 1 (incomplete), and 15\% did not achieve this first level. These assays were characterized by minimal in silico and in vitro testing, but their share in annually published eDNA assays has declined since 2014. The meta-analysis demonstrates the suitability of the 5-level validation scale for assessing targeted eDNA assays. It is a user-friendly tool to evaluate previously published assays for future research and routine monitoring, while also enabling the appropriate interpretation of results. Finally, it provides guidance on validation and reporting standards for newly developed assays.},

  abstract = {Marine ecosystems worldwide are under threat with many fish species and populations suffering from human over-exploitation. This is greatly impacting global biodiversity, economy and human health. Intriguingly, marine fish are largely surveyed using selective and invasive methods, which are mostly limited to commercial species, and restricted to particular areas with favourable conditions. Furthermore, misidentification of species represents a major problem. Here, we investigate the potential of using metabarcoding of environmental DNA (eDNA) obtained directly from seawater samples to account for marine fish biodiversity. This eDNA approach has recently been used successfully in freshwater environments, but never in marine settings. We isolate eDNA from 1/2-litre seawater samples collected in a temperate marine ecosystem in Denmark. Using next-generation DNA sequencing of PCR amplicons, we obtain eDNA from 15 different fish species, including both important consumption species, as well as species rarely or never recorded by conventional monitoring. We also detect eDNA from a rare vagrant species in the area; European pilchard (Sardina pilchardus). Additionally, we detect four bird species. Records in national databases confirmed the occurrence of all detected species. To investigate the efficiency of the eDNA approach, we compared its performance with 9 methods conventionally used in marine fish surveys. Promisingly, eDNA covered the fish diversity better than or equal to any of the applied conventional methods. Our study demonstrates that even small samples of seawater contain eDNA from a wide range of local fish species. Finally, in order to examine the potential dispersal of eDNA in oceans, we performed an experiment addressing eDNA degradation in seawater, which shows that even small (100-bp) eDNA fragments degrades beyond detectability within days. Although further studies are needed to validate the eDNA approach in varying environmental conditions, our findings provide a strong proof-of-concept with great perspectives for future monitoring of marine biodiversity and resources. © 2012 Thomsen et al.},

In this context, a dedicated survey was carried out in September 2022 along the Irish shelf break, where fishing (catch) and eDNA metabarcoding analysis using a portable high-throughput sequencer were performed to investigate the fish community of the upper mesopelagic layer. Catch data showed that the targeted layers consisted mainly of the young-of-the-year cohort of Mueller’s pearlside (Maurolicus muelleri), a mesopelagic fish, with little bycatch. eDNA data reflected the high prevalence of M. muelleri’s eDNA (56\%–97\% of assigned reads), identified species undetected by fishing, and showed that the least represented species differed in water samples collected before or after fishing activities. While this reflects current limitations of each technique, it also shows that a multidisciplinary approach may provide an increased level of resolution for M. muelleri layer’s ancillary fish community. Findings from the present study provided important insights to further refine sample acquisition and rapid processing of eDNA metabarcoding data, which beholds great potential to corroborate fishing methods when ground truthing acoustic approaches in mesopelagic fish layers assessments.},

  abstract = {Understanding patterns of diversity is central to ecology and conservation, yet estimates of diversity are often biased by imperfect detection. In recent years, multi-species occupancy models (MSOM) have been developed as a statistical tool to account for species-specific heterogeneity in detection while estimating true measures of diversity. Although the power of these models has been tested in various ways, their ability to estimate gamma diversity—or true community size, N is a largely unrecognized feature that needs rigorous evaluation. We use both simulations and an empirical dataset to evaluate the bias, precision, accuracy and coverage of estimates of N from MSOM compared to the widely applied iChao2 non-parametric estimator. We simulated 5,600 datasets across seven scenarios of varying average occupancy and detectability covariates, as well as varying numbers of sites, replicates and true community size. Additionally, we use a real dataset of surveys over 9~years (where species accumulation reached an asymptote, indicating true N), to estimate N from each annual survey. Simulations showed that both MSOM and iChao2 estimators are generally accurate (i.e. unbiased and precise) except under unideal scenarios where mean species occupancy is low. In such scenarios, MSOM frequently overestimated N. Across all scenarios, MSOM estimates were less certain than iChao2, but this led to over-confident iChao2 estimates that showed poor coverage. Results from the real dataset largely confirmed the simulation findings, with MSOM estimates showing greater accuracy and coverage than iChao2. Community ecologists have a wide choice of analytical methods, and both iChao2 and MSOM estimates of N are substantially preferable to raw species counts. The simplicity of non-parametric estimators has obvious advantages, but our results show that in many cases, MSOM may provide superior estimates that also account more accurately for uncertainty. Both methods can show strong bias when average occupancy is very low, and practitioners should show caution when using estimates derived from either method under such conditions.},

  abstract = {Some have suggested that targeting conservation efforts on biodiversity hotspots—areas of exceptionally high diversity—is the most efficient way to use limited resources to protect the most or rarest species. Moreover, the preservation of biodiversity is a focus for resource management and conservation because of the links between biodiversity and ecosystem function. However, there are many ways to define biodiversity and a plethora of diversity indices. Do these indices agree on where biodiversity hotspots are, and by extension, where conservation should take place? Here we use a habitat modeling approach to map spatial and temporal patterns in five community metrics of the demersal fish community in the California Current Large Marine Ecosystem: species density, species evenness, taxonomic distinctness, functional divergence and total biomass. Depth, bottom temperature, sediment grain size, and distance to hard substratum were included as covariates in the model. All indices showed strong spatial patterns and relationships with depth. Spatial patterns for functional divergence and total biomass varied among years, but other indices did not show temporal variation. We identified hotspots as cells where at least one index was in the top 5\% or 10\% of its range. There was minimal spatial overlap among 10\% hotspots for the five indices. Over 40\% of the study area was classified as a biodiversity hotspot by at least one metric. However, no area was identified as a hotspot by all five metrics, and only slightly more than one percent of the coast was identified as within a hotspot for three or more metrics. Since different indices represent various aspects of diversity, our results caution against the uninformed use of these indices in the identification of biodiversity hotspots. Instead, we must define our objectives and then choose the relevant metrics for the problem.},

  abstract = {In this article, the definition of sustainability is discussed, particularly in relation to the use of marine feed resources. The current review gives an overview of the development of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) aquaculture and how it has evolved due to changes in legal and management framework conditions. Atlantic salmon production is characterized with high utilization of nutrients, a high yield of production, and a large demand for rendered by-products. All of these factors compare favorably to production of most terrestrial farm animals. Historically, salmon feed has contained fishmeal and fish oil as the primary protein and fat source. Rising demand for feed ingredients has not increased pressure on forage fish resources. Rather, there has been an increased use of plant protein and fat sources. Increased utilization of plant ingredients may not be as sustainable as often claimed. Provided that marine harvest is carried out within legal frames, harvesting the marine ecosystem is a sustainable operation, and at present, the only significant source of long chain n-3 fatty acids. It is concluded that Atlantic salmon farming can be compared to raising a marine “super chicken” being among the most sustainable meat products in the world food market.},

  abstract = {Environmental DNA (eDNA) is DNA shed by organisms into surrounding environments such as soil and water. The new methods using eDNA as a marker for species detection are being rapidly developed. Here we explore basic knowledge regarding the dependence of the eDNA degradation rate on time and water temperature, and the relationship between eDNA degradation and bacterial abundance. This subject has not been well clarified, even though it is essential for improving the reliability of eDNA analysis. To determine the timeand water temperature-dependent degradation of eDNA, river water was sampled and eDNA concentrations were determined for ayu sweetfish (Plecoglossus altivelis altivelis) and common carp (Cyprinus carpio) at seven time points, over a 48-h period, and at three different water temperatures. The degradation of eDNA was modeled for each species using an existing exponential decay model with an extension to include water temperature effects. The degradation models were constructed for ayu sweetfish as Nt = 229,901.2 × exp [- (0.01062 × k - 0.07081) × t] and for common carp as Nt = 2,558.0 × exp [- (0.01075 × k - 0.07372) × t]. Nt is the DNA concentration at time t (elapsed time in hours) and k is the water temperature (°C). We also measured the concentration of eDNA derived from purified genomic DNA of the common carp, which was spiked into aquarium water without the target species, and we measured the bacterial abundance in the sample water after 12 and 24 h of incubation. Environmental DNA degradation was accelerated at higher water temperatures (generalized linear model, GLM; p {$<$} 0.001), but bacterial abundance did not have a significant effect on eDNA degradation (GLM, p = 0.097). These results suggest that the proper treatment of this temperature effect in data interpretations and adjustments would increase the reliability of eDNA analysis in future studies.},

However, whether known haplotypes contained in a sample can be detected correctly using eDNA‐based methods has been examined only by an aquarium experiment. Here, we tested whether the haplotypes of Ayu fish (               Plecoglossus altivelis altivelis               ) detected in a capture survey could also be detected from an eDNA sample derived from the field that contained various haplotypes with low concentrations and foreign substances. A water sample and Ayu specimens collected from a river on the same day were analysed by eDNA analysis and Sanger sequencing, respectively. The 10~L water sample was divided into 20 filters for each of which 15 PCR replications were performed. After high‐throughput sequencing, denoising was performed using two of the most widely used denoising packages,               unoise3               and               dada2               . Of the 42 haplotypes obtained from the Sanger sequencing of 96 specimens, 38 (               unoise3               ) and 41 (               dada2               ) haplotypes were detected by eDNA analysis. When               dada2               was used, except for one haplotype, haplotypes owned by at least two specimens were detected from all the filter replications. Accordingly, although it is important to note that eDNA‐based method has some limitations and some risk of false positive and false negative, this study showed that the eDNA analysis for evaluating intraspecific genetic diversity provides comparable results for large‐scale capture‐based conventional methods. Our results suggest that eDNA‐based methods could become a more efficient survey method for investigating intraspecific genetic diversity in the field.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            An understanding of the reproductive biology of aquatic organisms is crucial for the efficient conservation and management of species and/or populations. Nevertheless, conventional spawning surveys such as visual‐ and capture‐based monitoring generally require laborious, time‐consuming work and are subject to monitoring biases such as observer bias, as well as miscounts due to false spawning. In addition, direct capture often damages eggs or individuals. Thus, an efficient noninvasive approach for monitoring spawning events on aquatic species would be a valuable tool to understand their reproductive biology and conserving biodiversity. Here, we proposed an environmental DNA (eDNA)‐based approach for monitoring and understanding spawning events by observing spikes in eDNA concentration after spawning events. We found in hybridization experiment using two medaka species (               Oryzias latipes               and               Oryzias sakaizumii               , 1:1 individual per tank) that a spike in eDNA concentration occurred in male species after spawning. Besides, the magnitude of the spike in eDNA concentration was dependent on the number of spawning activities with egg and sperm release. In the field survey during the reproductive season, eDNA concentrations after spawning were 3–25 times higher than before the expected time for spawning. Additionally, there was no spike in eDNA concentration during the non‐reproductive season. Therefore, our results demonstrated that spike in eDNA concentration is mainly caused by the released sperm during spawning events, and it can be used as evidence of spawning in the field survey. The presented approach could be a practical tool for studying reproductive biology and provides an opportunity to design effective conservation and environmental management actions.},

  abstract = {Abstract             The simultaneous conservation of species richness and evenness is important to effectively reduce biodiversity loss and keep ecosystem health. Environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding has been used as a powerful tool for identifying community composition, but it does not necessarily provide quantitative information due to several methodological limitations. Thus, the quantification of eDNA through metabarcoding is an important frontier of eDNA-based biomonitoring. Particularly, the qMiSeq approach has recently been developed as a quantitative metabarcoding method and has attracted much attention due to its usefulness. The aim here was to evaluate the performance of the qMiSeq approach as a quantitative monitoring tool for fish communities by comparing the quantified eDNA concentrations with the results of fish capture surveys. The eDNA water sampling and the capture surveys using the electrical shocker were conducted at a total of 21 sites in four rivers in Japan. As a result, we found significant positive relationships between the~eDNA concentrations of each species quantified by qMiSeq and both the abundance and biomass of each captured taxon at each site. Furthermore, for seven out of eleven taxa, a significant positive relationship was observed between quantified DNA concentrations by sample and the abundance and/or biomass. In total, our results demonstrated that eDNA metabarcoding with the qMiSeq approach is a suitable and useful tool for quantitative monitoring of fish communities. Due to the simplicity of the eDNA analysis, the eDNA metabarcoding with qMiSeq approach would promote further growth of quantitative monitoring of biodiversity.},

  abstract = {Genetic identification of aqueous environmental DNA (eDNA) provides site occupancy inferences for rare aquatic macrofauna that are often easier to obtain than direct observations of organisms. This relative ease makes eDNA sampling a valuable tool for conservation biology. Research on the origin, state, transport, and fate of eDNA shed by aquatic macrofauna is needed to describe the spatiotemporal context for eDNA-based occupancy inferences and to guide eDNA sampling design. We tested the hypothesis that eDNA is more concentrated in surficial sediments than in surface water by measuring the concentration of aqueous and sedimentary eDNA from an invasive fish, bigheaded Asian carp (Hypophthalmichthys spp.), in experimental ponds and natural rivers. We modified a simple, low-cost DNA extraction method to yield inhibitor-free eDNA from both sediment and water samples. Carp eDNA was 8-1800 times more concentrated per gram of sediment than per milliliter of water and was detected in sediments up to 132. days after carp removal - five times longer than any previous reports of macrobial eDNA persistence in water. These results may be explained by particle settling and/or retarded degradation of sediment-adsorbed DNA molecules. Compared to aqueous eDNA, sedimentary eDNA could provide a more abundant and longer-lasting source of genetic material for inferring current-or-past site occupancy by aquatic macrofauna, particularly benthic species. However, resuspension and transport of sedimentary eDNA could complicate the spatiotemporal inferences from surface water sampling, which is currently the predominant eDNA-based approach. We discuss these implications in the context of conservation-oriented monitoring in aquatic ecosystems.},

  abstract = {Aquaculture impacts on marine benthic ecosystems are widely recognized and monitored. However, little is known about the community changes occurring in the water masses surrounding aquaculture sites. In the present study, we studied the eukaryotic communities inside and outside salmonid aquaculture cages through time to assess the community changes in the neighbouring waters of the farm. Water samples were taken biweekly over five~months during the production phase from inside the cages and from nearby points located North and South of the salmon farm. Eukaryotic communities were analyzed by eDNA metabarcoding of the partial COI Leray-XT fragment. The results showed that eukaryotic communities inside the cages were significantly different from those in the outside environment, with communities inside the cages having higher diversity values and more indicator species associated with them. This is likely explained by the appearance of fouling species that colonize the artificial structures, but also by other species that are attracted to the cages by other means. Moreover, these effects were highly localized inside the cages, as the communities identified outside the cages, both North and South, had very similar eukaryotic composition at each point in time. Overall, the eukaryotic communities, both inside and outside the cages, showed similar temporal fluctuations through the summer months, with diversity peaks occurring at the end of July, beginning of September, and in the beginning of November, with the latter showing the highest Shannon diversity and richness values. Hence, our study suggests that seasonality, together with salmonid aquaculture, are the main drivers of eukaryotic community structure in surface waters surrounding the farm.},

However, it is important to distinguish between the species-area relationship and species accumulation curves. The species-area relationship is concerned with the number of species in areas of different size irrespective of the identity of the species within the areas, whereas the species accumulation curve is concerned with accumulation rates of new species over the sampled area and depends on species identity. 2. We derive an exact analytical expression for the expectance and variance of the species- accumulation curve in all random subsets of samples from a given area. The analytical species accumulation curve may be approximated by a semilog curve. Both the exact accumulation curve and its semilog approximation are independent of the underlying species abundance distributions, but are influenced strongly by the distribution of species among the samples and the spatial relationship of the samples that are randomized. 3. To estimate species richness in larger areas than that sampled we take account of the spatial relationship between samples by dividing the sampled area into subareas. First a species-accumulation curve is obtained for randomized samples of all the single subareas. Then the species-accumulation curve for all combinations of two subareas is calculated and the procedure is repeated for all subareas. From these curves a new total species (T-S) curve is obtained from the terminal point of the subarea plots. The T-S curve can then be extrapolated to estimate the probable total number of species in the area studied. 4. Data from the Norwegian continental shelf show that extrapolation of the traditional species-accumulation curve gave a large underestimate of total species richness for the whole shelf compared with that predicted by the T-S curve. Application of non- parametric methods also gave large underestimates compared with actual data obtained from more extensive sampling than the data analysed here. Although marine soft sediments sampled in Hong Kong were not as variable as those from the Norwegian shelf, nevertheless here the new method also gave higher estimates of total richness than the traditional species-accumulation approaches. 5. Our data show that both the species-accumulation curve and the accompanying T-S curve apply to large heterogeneous areas varying in depth and sediment properties as well as a relatively small homogeneous area with small variation in depth and sediment properties.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Environmental DNA (eDNA) has attracted interest in relation to fisheries, with its possibilities for species identification and promises for species quantification. In the context of fisheries catches, eDNA can be most useful for the estimation of bycatch proportions. The assessment of species mixtures in large catches (\&gt;1000\,t) is challenging, especially when morphologically similar species are to be differentiated. We used an experimental set-up to simulate industrial sprat fishery catches, and tested two types of water (blood water and discharge water) derived from this simulated fishery for their suitability in reliable species quantification. We analysed nine mixtures of sprat and herring—the main bycatch species. Species-specific quantitative PCR was used for species identification and quantification. Species-to-species weight fractions and eDNA fractions in mixtures showed a strong correlation. Accounting for size-based differences in DNA abundance (allometrically scaled weight) reduced the estimated standard error on weight fraction prediction from 0.064 to 0.054 in blood water, and from 0.080 to 0.075 in discharge water when comparing the weight-based model with the allometrically scaled weight model, respectively. Accounting for allometric scalling in genetic analyses of fisheries process water can serve as a more precise method for the assessment of bycatch, thus in a wider sense improve the quality of fisheries-dependent data.},

  abstract = {Terrestrial animals must have frequent contact with water to survive, implying that environmental DNA (eDNA) originating from those animals should be detectable from places containing water in terrestrial ecosystems. Aiming to detect the presence of terrestrial mammals using forest water samples, we applied a set of universal PCR primers (MiMammal, a modified version of fish universal primers) for metabarcoding mammalian eDNA. The versatility of MiMammal primers was tested in silico and by amplifying DNAs extracted from tissues. The results suggested that MiMammal primers are capable of amplifying and distinguishing a diverse group of mammalian species. In addition, analyses of water samples from zoo cages of mammals with known species composition suggested that MiMammal primers could successfully detect mammalian species from water samples in the field. Then, we performed an experiment to detect mammals from natural ecosystems by collecting five 500-ml water samples from ponds in two cool-temperate forests in Hokkaido, northern Japan. MiMammal amplicon libraries were constructed using eDNA extracted from water samples, and sequences generated by Illumina MiSeq were subjected to data processing and taxonomic assignment. We thereby detected multiple species of mammals common to the sampling areas, including deer (Cervus nippon), mouse (Mus musculus), vole (Myodes rufocanus), raccoon (Procyon lotor), rat (Rattus norvegicus) and shrew (Sorex unguiculatus). Many previous applications of the eDNA metabarcoding approach have been limited to aquatic/semiaquatic systems, but the results presented here show that the approach is also promising even for forest mammal biodiversity surveys.},

  abstract = {Biodiversity has been recognized as one of the key components of environmental sustainability. Assessment of biodiversity trends and progress toward targets requires effective and sound indicators. In our article, we review and compare the leading multispecies biodiversity indices used in global and regional assessments. We reviewed basic characteristics of these aggregated and composite biodiversity indicators and evaluated them with regard to their ecological performance, policy relevance and other accounting aspects. Indices analyzed include species and populations based indicators, such as Living Planet Index and Red List Index, as well as ecosystem based indicators like Natural Capital Index and Biodiversity Intactness Index. We also include measures of ecological integrity such as Marine Trophic Index and Index of Biotic Integrity. Indicators analyzed differ in both their ecological focus, baselines, basic units or policy use. Multispecies biodiversity indices illustrate prevailingly negative trends in the state of nature as a result of human induced pressures, especially land cover change. Biodiversity loss is therefore not decoupled from socioeconomic progress. We show that current indicators include a balanced mix of important biodiversity aspects and have some policy resonance. Leading biodiversity indices should be further promoted and integrated into monitoring, modelling and decision-making frameworks. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Marine biodiversity can be surveyed using underwater visual censuses and recently with eDNA metabarcoding. Although a promising tool, eDNA studies have shown contrasting results related to its detection scale and the number of species identified compared to other survey methods. Also, its accuracy relies on complete reference databases used for taxonomic assignment and, as other survey methods, species detection may show false‐negative and false‐positive errors. Here, we compared results from underwater visual censuses and simultaneous eDNA metabarcoding fish surveys in terms of observed species and community composition. We also assess the effect of a custom reference database in the taxonomic assignment, and evaluate occupancy, capture and detection probabilities, as well as error rates of eDNA survey data. We amplified a 12S rRNA fish barcode from 24 sampling sites in the gulf of California. More species were detected with eDNA metabarcoding than with UVC. Because each survey method largely detected different sets of species, the combined approach doubled the number of species registered. Both survey methods recovered a known biodiversity gradient and a biogeographic break, but eDNA captured diversity over a broader geographic and bathymetric scale. Furthermore, the use of a modest‐sized custom reference database significantly increased taxonomic assignment. In a subset of species, occupancy models revealed eDNA surveys provided similar or higher detection probabilities compared to UVC. The occupancy value of each species had a large influence on eDNA detectability, and in the false positive and negative error. Overall, these results highlight the potential of eDNA metabarcoding in complementing other established ecological methods for studies of marine fishes.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Global biodiversity in freshwater and the oceans is declining at high rates. Reliable tools for assessing and monitoring aquatic biodiversity, especially for rare and secretive species, are important for efficient and timely management. Recent advances in               DNA               sequencing have provided a new tool for species detection from               DNA               present in the environment. In this study, we tested whether an environmental               DNA               (               eDNA               ) metabarcoding approach, using water samples, can be used for addressing significant questions in ecology and conservation. Two key aquatic vertebrate groups were targeted: amphibians and bony fish. The reliability of this method was cautiously validated in silico, in~vitro and in~situ. When compared with traditional surveys or historical data,               eDNA               metabarcoding showed a much better detection probability overall. For amphibians, the detection probability with               eDNA               metabarcoding was 0.97 (               CI               ~=~0.90–0.99) vs. 0.58 (               CI               ~=~0.50–0.63) for traditional surveys. For fish, in 89\% of the studied sites, the number of taxa detected using the               eDNA               metabarcoding approach was higher or identical to the number detected using traditional methods. We argue that the proposed               DNA               ‐based approach has the potential to become the next‐generation tool for ecological studies and standardized biodiversity monitoring in a wide range of aquatic ecosystems.                        ,                             see also the Perspective by Hoffmann, Schubert and Calvignac‐Spencer},

Several barcode loci targeting teleost fish and elasmobranchs have previously been developed, but to date primer sets focusing on other marine megafauna, such as marine mammals, have received less attention. Similarly, there have been few attempts to identify potentially “universal” barcode loci which may be informative across multiple marine vertebrate orders. Here we describe the design and validation of two new sets of primers targeting hypervariable regions of the vertebrate mitochondrial 12S and 16S rRNA genes, which have conserved priming sites across virtually all cetaceans, pinnipeds, elasmobranchs, boney fish, sea turtles, and birds, and amplify fragments with consistently high levels of taxonomically diagnostic sequence variation. “In silico” validation using the OBITOOLS software showed our new barcode loci outperformed most existing vertebrate barcode loci for taxon detection and resolution. We also evaluated sequence diversity and taxonomic resolution of the new barcode loci in 680 complete marine mammal mitochondrial genomes demonstrating that they are effective at resolving amplicons for most taxa to the species level. Finally, we evaluated the performance of the primer sets with eDNA samples from aquarium communities with known species composition. These new primers will potentially allow surveys of complete marine vertebrate communities in single HTS metabarcoding assessments, simplifying workflows, reducing costs, and increasing accessibility to a wider range of investigators.},

  abstract = {Over the last 25 years, a much broader range of taxonomic studies of bacteria has gradually replaced the former reliance upon morphological, physiological, and biochemical characterization. This polyphasic taxonomy takes into account all available phenotypic and genotypic data and integrates them in a consensus type of classification, framed in a general phylogeny derived from 16S rRNA sequence analysis. In some cases, the consensus classification is a compromise containing a minimum of contradictions. It is thought that the more parameters that will become available in the future, the more polyphasic classification will gain stability. In this review, the practice of polyphasic taxonomy is discussed for four groups of bacteria chosen for their relevance, complexity, or both: the genera Xanthomonas and Campylobacter, the lactic acid bacteria, and the family Comamonadaceae. An evaluation of our present insights, the conclusions derived from it, and the perspectives of polyphasic taxonomy are discussed, emphasizing the keystone role of the species. Taxonomists did not succeed in standardizing species delimitation by using percent DNA hybridization values. Together with the absence of another "gold standard" for species definition, this has an enormous repercussion on bacterial taxonomy. This problem is faced in polyphasic taxonomy, which does not depend on a theory, a hypothesis, or a set of rules, presenting a pragmatic approach to a consensus type of taxonomy, integrating all available data maximally. In the future, polyphasic taxonomy will have to cope with (i) enormous amounts of data, (ii) large numbers of strains, and (iii) data fusion (data aggregation), which will demand efficient and centralized data storage. In the future, taxonomic studies will require collaborative efforts by specialized laboratories even more than now is the case. Whether these future developments will guarantee a more stable consensus classification remains an open question.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT             The use of environmental DNA to detect species is now widespread in freshwater ecology. However, the detectability of species depends on many factors, such as the quantity of eDNA particles available in the environment and their state (e.g., free DNA fragments, organellar, or aggregated DNA particles). To date, the most advanced knowledge of the production and state of DNA particles concerns teleosts. Most often, these studies target mitochondrial genes, since they are present in multiple copies in a cell. However, it is likely that the characteristics of eDNA molecules vary greatly among taxa and genetic compartments, with direct consequences for species detection. Using an indoor mesocosm experiment, we compared the rate of mitochondrial and nuclear eDNA production and particle size distribution (PSD) of four distinct and common aquatic taxa (zebrafish, tadpole, isopod and mollusk). The tank water was filtered through a series of filters with decreasing porosity and mitochondrial and nuclear eDNA at each size fraction were quantified by qPCR. We found that the production and the size of eDNA particles varied greatly among taxa and genetic compartments. For most taxa, the number of nuclear eDNA particles released in water was higher than that of mitochondrial origin. The PSD of mt‐eDNA showed a pattern common to all taxa: the relative number of particles increased from the smallest size fractions (0.2\,μm and less) to the largest (over 1.2\,μm), while the distribution of nu‐eDNA was very different from one taxon to another. We also observed a high temporal variability in the quantity of eDNA particles and in PSD, although the latter was more complex to model. These results call for caution in how to sample and analyze eDNA in aquatic environments, particularly for organisms that emit small particles in small quantities such as isopods.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding is a method to detect taxa from environmental samples. It is increasingly used for marine biodiversity surveys. As it only requires water collection, eDNA metabarcoding is less invasive than scientific trawling and might be more cost effective. Here, we analysed data from both sampling methods applied in the same scientific survey targeting Northeast Atlantic fish in the Bay of Biscay. We compared the methods regarding the distribution of taxonomic, phylogenetic, and functional diversity. We found that eDNA captured more taxonomic and phylogenetic richness than bottom trawling and more functional richness at the local scale. eDNA was less selective than trawling and detected species in local communities spanning larger phylogenetic and functional breadths, especially as it detected large pelagic species that escaped the trawl, even though trawling detected more flat fish. eDNA indicated differences in fish community composition that were comparable to those based on trawling. However, consistency between abundance estimates provided by eDNA metabarcoding and trawl catches was low, even after accounting for allometric scaling in eDNA production. We conclude that eDNA metabarcoding is a promising method that can complement scientific trawling for multi-component biodiversity monitoring based on presence/absence, but not yet for abundance.},

In this work, we use a kelp forest ecosystem in Baja California, Mexico to present a novel approach, comparing two network models based on different information sources. First, we developed a conventional scientific knowledge network model (CSK) parameterized with in-situ observations. Second, we used a local ecological knowledge network model (LEK) based on interviews with local fishers. Our main objectives were: (a) verify if the two knowledge sources generated comparable models, and (b) explore model responses to disturbance scenarios. The CSK model presented greater detail at lower trophic levels, contrary to the LEK model. Additionally, we simulated top-down and bottom-up ecological disturbances. With a top-down disturbance, the groups’ abundance increased following a cascade effect whereas, in the bottom-up disturbance, changes did not transfer uniformly. We also simulated anthropogenic disturbances through fishing pressure on three target species (lobsters, sea urchins, and sea bass). Our findings show similar patterns with the highest degree of change when lobsters are removed. Our findings highlight the potential of model complementarity and support the relevance of ecological network models to navigate future climate and anthropogenic uncertainty.},

  abstract = {The stock of capelin, Mallotus villosus (Müller), that inhabits the area between Iceland, East Greenland, and the island of Jan Mayen spawns in shallow coastal water south and west of Iceland. Juveniles grow up over the continental shelf off north Iceland and off East Greenland west of the Denmark Strait. The main feeding area of adults is the Iceland Sea, the oceanic area from about 68 to 72°N, between the Jan Mayen Ridge and the East Greenland continental shelf. After the feeding season, the adult stock assembles over the outer shelf off north Iceland and migrates to the spawning grounds along the south and west coasts from December to March. The main oceanographic features of Icelandic waters and the Iceland Sea are described and capelin migrations related to the distribution of water masses and the ocean current systems in the area. In the past two decades there have been large variations in capelin migrations and catchability, especially during the feeding season. However, these variations can only be explained in part by the available environmental data. Year-class abundance appears to be determined by survival during the first winter, in tune with the greater environmental variability off north Iceland than south and west of Iceland, where these capelin spawn and the larvae start drifting. Adult growth is positively related to the flow of Atlantic water into the area north of Iceland, indicating improved feeding conditions in the Iceland Sea when the Irminger Current is strong. There can be large interannual variations in number and weight-at-age in the adult stock. The main predators are whales, seabirds, and fish, especially cod. The combined annual removal by predators is estimated to have been 2.1-3.4 million tonnes in the early 1990s. The mean weight-at-age of cod aged 5-8 years dropped by up to 25-30\% when capelin abundance was low in the early 1980s and 1990s. The relatively low mean weight of cod in the past 3 years may well be due to changed distribution and migration of capelin, resulting in reduced access of cod to this most important item in their diet. © 2002 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.

  abstract = {Abstract                            Predator–prey interactions are critical in understanding how communities function. However, we need to describe intraspecific variation in diet to accurately depict those interactions. Harbor seals (               Phoca vitulina               ) are an abundant marine predator that prey on species of conservation concern. We estimated intrapopulation feeding diversity (variation in feeding habits between individuals of the same species) of harbor seals in the Salish Sea. Estimates of feeding diversity were examined relative to sex, month, and location using a novel approach that combined molecular techniques, repeated cross‐sectional sampling of scat, and a specialization metric (within‐individual consistency in diet measured by the Proportional Similarity Index (                              )). Based on 1,083 scat samples collected from five haul‐out sites during four nonsequential years, we quantified diet using metabarcoding techniques and determined the sex of the scat depositor using a molecular assay. Results suggest that intrapopulation feeding diversity was present. Specialization was high over short periods (24–48~hr,                              ~=~0.392, 95\% CI~=~0.013, R~=~100,000) and variable in time and space. Females showed more specialization than males, particularly during summer and fall. Additionally, demersal and benthic prey species were correlated with more specialized diets. The latter finding suggests that this type of prey likely requires specific foraging strategies and that there are trade‐offs between pelagic and benthic foraging styles for harbor seals. This differential feeding on prey species, as well as between sexes of harbor seals, indicates that predator–prey interactions in harbor seals are complex and that each sex may have a different impact on species of conservation concern. As such, describing intrapopulation feeding diversity may unravel hitherto unknown complex predator–prey interactions in the community.},

The results showed that 57 and 65 fish species were recorded in spring and summer, respectively, with 46 species identified in both seasons. A total of nine dominant species were identified in spring, mainly belonging to Perciformes, while seven dominant species were identified in summer, primarily from Clupeiformes. In different regions, no significant differences in fish α diversity were observed between spring and summer. However, significant seasonal differences were found in both α and β diversity. At the spatial level, fish species in the Yellow and Bohai Seas occupied similar ecological niches. However, at the temporal level, there are certain differences in the ecological niches of fish communities between seasons. Phylogenetic diversity showed no significant differences at the spatial scale, yet notable seasonal variations were observed at the temporal scale, with spring (661.46) significantly exceeding summer (540.30). The Mantel test indicated that nitrate and salinity were key environmental factors influencing α diversity. RDA analysis revealed that the dominant species in spring were mainly influenced by chlorophyll-a and water temperature, while those in summer were mainly affected by water depth, nitrite, water temperature, and salinity.},

  abstract = {Biodiversity assessment of marine hard-bottom communities is hindered by the high diversity and size-ranges of the organisms present. Wedeveloped aDNAmetabarcoding protocol for biodiversity characterization of structurally complex natural marine hardbottom communities. We used two molecular markers: the ``Leray fragment'' of mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase (COI), for which a novel primer set was developed, and the V7 region of the nuclear small subunit ribosomal RNA (18S). Eight different shallow marine littoral communities from two National Parks in Spain (one in the Atlantic Ocean and another in the Mediterranean Sea) were studied. Samples were sieved into three size fractions from where DNA was extracted separately. Bayesian clustering was used for delimiting molecular operational taxonomic units (MOTUs) and custom reference databases were constructed for taxonomic assignment. Despite applying stringent filters, we found high values for MOTU richness (2,510 and 9,679 MOTUs with 18S and COI, respectively), suggesting that these communities host a large amount of yet undescribed eukaryotic biodiversity. Significant gaps are still found in sequence reference databases, which currently prevent the complete taxonomic assignment of the detected sequences. In our dataset, 85\% of 18S MOTUs and 64\% of COI MOTUs could be identified to phylum or lower taxonomic level. Nevertheless, those unassigned were mostly rare MOTUs with low numbers of reads, and assigned MOTUs comprised over 90\% of the total sequence reads. The identification rate might be significantly improved in the future, as reference databases are further completed. Our results show that marine metabarcoding, currently applied mostly to plankton or sediments, can be adapted to structurally complex hard bottom samples. Thus, eukaryotic metabarcoding emerges as a robust, fast, objective and affordable method to comprehensively characterize the diversity of marine benthic communities dominated by macroscopic seaweeds and colonial or modular sessile metazoans. The 18S marker lacks species-level resolution and thus cannot be recommended to assess the detailed taxonomic composition of these communities. Our new universal primers for COI can potentially be used for biodiversity assessment with high taxonomic resolution in a wide array of marine, terrestrial or freshwater eukaryotic communities.},

A marginally better relationship with the impact axis of the meta-analysis is achieved by a moderate (square root) transformation of the data. 'Production' data (an appropriate combination of abundance and biomass information) provide only a marginal improvement on abundance data, but are ecologically and functionally much more relevant. Severe transformation of the data, culminating in presence/absence, degrades the relationship with the impact axis, but if only simple species lists are available then these may still be useable in making an environmental assessment. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract = {1. Introduction Countless documents have focussed upon the rapid changes that are being observed in the Arctic (e.g. ACIA, 2004). Atmospheric warming has increased Arctic Ocean (AO) temperature and resulted in decreased extent and thickness of sea ice (Comiso, 2003; Kwok and Rothrock, 2009). Sea ice extent is now decreasing at a rate of about 10\% per decade (Stroeve et al., 2007; Comiso et al., 2008). After the rapid melting in 2007, a slower negative trend was re-established in 2008–2010, but the AO (covered mostly by first-year ice) will probably be largely ice-free in late summer in a few decades. In addition, the average thickness of the ice has decreased steadily (Kwok and Rothrock, 2009), freshwater inputs have increased (McPhee et al., 2009; Yamamoto-Kawai et al., 2009) and transport towards the Fram Strait has increased (von Eye et al., 2009). These striking changes in physical forcing have left marine ecological foot-prints of climate change in the Arctic ecosystem (Wassmann et al., 2010b). However, predicting the future of the pan-Arctic ecosystem remains a challenge not only because of the ever-accelerating nature of both physical and biological alterations, but also because of a stag-gering lack of marine ecological knowledge. The AO is a circular system engirdled by land, i.e. a mediterra-nean sea (sensu Dietrich et al., 1980; Tomczak and Godfrey, 2001), encompassing several distinctive characteristics that cannot be revealed by research in its various sectors. At present the amount of scientific exploration that has been done is inadequate in terms of geographic coverage, time coverage and precision to describe the circumpolar features, local/regional disparities and the complexities of the AO ecosystem (Wassmann, 2006). How-ever, recent studies on biogeochemistry, marine ecology and phys-ical forcing in the pan-Arctic region (e.g. through the 4th International Polar Year (IPY), that just has come to the end of its exploratory phase) have led to a rapid increase in knowledge about region as a whole. The international symposium C flux and climate change: The Nordic contribution to a pan-Arctic perspective in 2002 was crucial in the development of the marine pan-Arctic perspec-tive. That was the meeting where Arctic oceanographers sincerely started using the now-ubiquitous term 'pan-Arctic'. Here the idea was broached to synthesize the emerging image of pan-Arctic food webs and ecosystem structure in a dedicated volume: Structure and function of contemporary food webs on Arctic shelves (Wassmann, 2006). Pan-Arctic overviews on ecosystems and food webs were assembled for the first time. Based upon this exercise, increased interest in the Arctic and some of the scientific endeavours of the 4th IPY an attempt was made to convene central projects and key oceanographers operating in the pan-Arctic region at the sym-posium Arctic Marine Ecosystems in an Era of Rapid Climate Change (www.arctic-frontiers.com) in Tromsø in January 2009. Building upon the foundation presented in Wassmann (2006) efforts were made to encourage further pan-Arctic integration. To this end, se-lected scientists working throughout the pan-Arctic were asked to summarize their information on the ecology of the pan-Arctic. It is the extraordinary atmosphere and the enthusiastic character of the Tromsø conference that is embodied in the present volume. The present synopsis is based upon the comprehensive perspectives and unifying concepts presented by Carmack and Wassmann (2006). It focuses on how the pan-Arctic is depicted today, summa-rizing available investigations done in the various national sectors or in AO as a whole. We also highlight some of the major ecological questions that are common for the pan-Arctic region as well as the ecological implications of climate change. Towards the end of the synopsis we converge upon future research challenges and argue for a change in the international attitude towards Arctic oceanog-raphy in general and marine ecosystem research in particular. 2. Pan-Arctic ecosystems: what do we know? Fig. 1 provides an overview over regions for which publications summarizing the ecosystems are already available, or are being made available through this volume. Most of them are centered on the Fram Strait – Svalbard – Barents Sea (BS) region. Also in the Bering Strait – Chukchi Sea, Canadian Beaufort Sea and south-western Greenland overviews and progress summaries on ecosys-tems are available, but many recent intensive investigations have not been summarized as yet. There are two key regions from which only a dearth of ecosystem information is available: the wide cen-tral AO and the extensive Siberian shelf. The lack of ecosystems overview from the central AO is understandable in view of the difficulty of gaining access to the productive zones of this vast re-gion, and doing so not just once but repeatedly over several years. Current ecological information is often based on snapshots derived from periodic visits of icebreakers (e.g. Gosselin et al., 1997) or painstakingly assembled collages of data sets for some of the more long-lived organisms such as copepods (e.g. Kosobokova and Hopcroft, 2010). From the immense Siberian shelf only two summaries are available (Hirche et al., 2006; Schmid et al., 2006), but even these consider only a narrow annual time window or only a selection of ecological elements. Biological data from the central Arctic Basin and the Russian shelves appear to exist mainly in re-ports and field work journals that are scattered, frequently not compiled and basically never published, not even in Russian. q Finally, since zoogeography is a study of a dynamic, not a static, phenomenon, and since changes in the distribution of marine animals can be of decisive economic importance, it is necessary to keep routine observations going every year, or at regular intervals, not only upon the fauna itself, but upon the hydrographic conditions which, more than anything else, determine the composition of the fauna (Arctic and Subarctic marine ecology: immediate problems (Dunbar, 1953)).},

First, a cage farming model is introduced for analysis of the needs of intelligent monitoring and control technology. The applications of underwater robots, unmanned aerial vehicles, online monitoring networks and other technologies involved in aquaculture water environment information monitoring are summarized. Secondly, the intelligent management of cages is summarized. This paper demonstrates that cage farming is the trend of aquaculture. In the future, applications will combine information monitoring technology, intelligent control technology, and intelligent equipment technology to realize intelligent, digital, automatic and unmanned operation of cage aquaculture.},

However, information on community structure or distribution of many species that occupy deep ({$>$}30 m) waters is largely unavailable. We amassed a total of 24 686 fish observations of 523 species/taxa for the 30-410 m depth areas surrounding the main Hawaiian Islands (MHI). We also obtained estimates of geomorphological variables, including substrate type, slope, rugosity, and ridge-like features. Using these 2 data sources, we (1) identified distinct fish communities along the 30-410 m depth gradient, and (2) generated relative biomass maps for fish functional groups. We showed that the mesophotic zone ranges between 30 and 129 m, with a fish faunal break at 60 m. Beyond this zone, 4 subphotic zones were identified: upper rariphotic (130-169 m), mid-rariphotic (170-239 m), lower rariphotic (240-319 m), and upper bathyal (320-410 m). We assigned fish species to functional groups partly based on identified depth ranges and fitted general additive models (GAMs) integrating geomorphological covariates to the functional group relative biomass estimates to determine the environmental variables that best predict the probability of encounter and relative biomass of each fish functional group. Finally, GAM predictions were employed to map functional group relative biomass distributions. These distribution maps showed a high relative biomass of many groups in the center of the MHI chain. This study contributes to a better understanding of fish community structure around the MHI and will inform ecosystem model parameterization.},

  abstract = {There is now little doubt that the world’s fisheries are in crisis. Mounting scientific evidence points to dramatic declines in global catches.1,2 Increasingly, many are making the case that farming fish offers a solution to meeting the growing demand for seafood that catching fish cannot provide. Aquaculture now accounts for roughly one-third of the world’s total supply of food fish and undoubtedly the contribution of aquaculture to seafood supplies will increase in the future. Aquaculture has the potential to become a sustainable practice that can supplement capture fisheries and significantly contribute to feeding the world’s growing population. However, instead of helping to ease the crisis in wild fisheries, unsustainable aquaculture development could exacerbate the problems and create new ones, damaging our important and already-stressed coastal areas. The vast majority of aquaculture takes place in Asia. In 2002, over 70\% of worldwide aquaculture production was in China alone.3 Most farmed fish and shellfish are grown in traditional small-scale systems that benefit local communities and minimize the environmental impact. Utilizing simple culture technologies and minimal inputs, these systems have been used for centuries. The net contribution of these traditional aquaculture systems can be great as they offer many benefits, including food security in developing nations. However, as happened with the “green revolution” of agriculture in the last century, the current “blue revolution” of aquaculture is becoming an industrial mode of food production. An emerging trend is toward the increased development of farming high-value carnivorous fish species using environmentally and socially damaging systems. Farming fish on an industrial scale, especially carnivorous fish is rapidly expanding; the number of different species farmed and geographic regions where they are farmed increases continually. Largely controlled by multinational corporations, industrialized farming of carnivorous fish such as salmon requires the intensive use of resources and exports problems to the surrounding environment, often resulting in environmental impacts and social conflicts.},

The biomass data for Brazil, a major site for deforestation, are few and of uncertain accuracy. Recent international agreements, however, require national inventories of sources and sinks for atmospheric greenhouse gases; such inventories will need better estimates of biomass and their uncertainties. To provide additional information on biomass uncertainty and on forest structure in southwestern Amazonia, a region of active deforestation, we measured in 1988 the diameter, bole and canopy heights of 474 trees covering a total of 1 ha (10 000 m(2)) in the Ecological Station of the Samuel Hydroelectric Reservoir in Rondonia (845'S, 63 degrees 23'W). Using allometric equations based on destructively sampled trees, we estimated the largest biomass component, standing alive aboveground biomass (SAAB), as 285 Mg (dry weight) ha(-1). Fallen trunks and litter were 30 Mg and 10 Mg ha(-1), respectively, The sum of these components, 325 Mg ha(-1), is an underestimate of the total biomass because the biomass of roots, vines, shrubs, and small trees was not measured. Measurement error of SAAB is +/- 20\%, +/- 57 Mg ha(-1) about the mean (95\% confidence interval), as derived by a Monte Carlo simulation. The SAAB distribution among trees is highly skewed: 3\% of the trees contain 50\% of the SAAB. For forests of similar distributions, sampling units typically used for biomass estimates (less than 2000 m(2)) will usually produce biomass estimates significantly different from those of larger units. Based on subsamples of our data, sampling units of 1000 m(2) or smaller had at least a 75\% chance of being outside the confidence interval of the global mean (228-342 Mg ha(-1)) derived from Monte Carlo simulation. To improve estimates of SAAB in similar forests a sampling program should focus on emergent and large canopy trees, the dominant contributors to biomass.},

We used this ice-free arctic fjord as a model area to investigate (1) how the vertical flux of biomass (chlorophyll a and particulate organic carbon, POC) follows the seasonality of suspended material, (2) how sinking particle characteristics change seasonally and affect the vertical flux, and (3) if the vertical flux in the ice-free arctic fjord with glacial runoff resembles the flux in subarctic ice-free fjords. During seven field investigations (December 2011-September 2012), suspended biomass was determined (5, 15, 25, and 60m), and short-term sediment traps were deployed (20, 30, 40, and 60m), partly modified with gel-filled jars to study the size and frequency distribution of sinking particles. During winter, resuspension from the seafloor resulted in large, detrital sinking particles. Intense sedimentation of fresh biomass occurred during the spring bloom. The highest POC flux was found during autumn (770-1530mg POC m-2 d-1), associated with sediment-loaded glacial runoff and high pteropod abundances. The vertical biomass flux in the ice-free arctic Adventfjorden thus resembled that in subarctic fjords during winter and spring, but a higher POC sedimentation was observed during autumn.},

Marine investigations were conducted at irregular intervals until the area was covered by the routine research activities of the Institute of Marine Research (IMR). The objective of this paper is to present an annotated list of species recorded in the Fisheries Zone around Jan Mayen, and to give an overview of the change in species composition and distribution. The data are based on scientific collections, literature citings and the IMR database. Between 1877 and 2009, 71 fish species have been recorded in the area, of which 43 are documented by voucher specimens. The zoarcid species Lycenchelys platyrhina is endemic to the area. Results show an increase in the number of species over the last 40 years, 40 of the 71 species were registered for the first time after 1970. This, on the one hand, is due to complete catch registration and better species identification, and on the other hand, to an enlargement of the species' distribution area and immigration into the Jan Mayen area of other species. The data provides basic information for future monitoring of the area, especially as the polar regions may be strongly affected by climate change, which may have an impact on species abundance and distribution. © 2010 Senckenberg, Gesellschaft für Naturforschung and Springer.},

  abstract = {We report the first application of CRISPR-Cas technology to single species detection from environmental DNA (eDNA). Organisms shed and excrete DNA into their environment such as in skin cells and faeces, referred to as environmental DNA (eDNA). Utilising eDNA allows noninvasive monitoring with increased specificity and sensitivity. Current methods primarily employ PCR-based techniques to detect a given species from eDNA samples, posing a logistical challenge for on-site monitoring and potential adaptation to biosensor devices. We have developed an alternative method; coupling isothermal amplification to a CRISPR-Cas12a detection system. This utilises the collateral cleavage activity of Cas12a, a ribonuclease guided by a highly specific single CRISPR RNA. We used the target species Salmo salar as a proof-of-concept test of the specificity of the assay among closely related species and to show the assay is successful at a single temperature of 37°C with signal detection at 535~nM. The specific assay, detects at attomolar sensitivity with rapid detection rates ('2.5~hr). This approach simplifies the challenge of building a biosensor device for rapid target species detection in the field and can be easily adapted to detect any species from eDNA samples from a variety of sources enhancing the capabilities of eDNA as a tool for monitoring biodiversity.},

Nonetheless, notable exceptions to the general pattern exist, and it is well recognized that patterns may be dependent on characteristics of spatial scale and taxonomic hierarchy. We conducted an extensive survey of the literature and provide a synthetic assessment of the degree to which variation in patterns (positive linear, negative linear, modal, or nonsignificant) is a consequence of characteristics of scale (extent or focus) or taxon. In addition, we considered latitudinal gradients with respect to generic and familial richness, as well as species evenness and diversity. We provide a classification of the over 30 hypotheses advanced to account for the latitudinal gradient, and we discuss seven hypotheses with most promise for advancing ecological, biogeographic, and evolutionary understanding. We conclude with a forward-looking synthesis and list of fertile areas for future research.},

Extensive literature discusses different methods for describing diversity and documenting its effects on ecosystem health and function. However, it is widely believed that diversity depends on the intensity of sampling. I discuss a statistical perspective on diversity, framing the diversity of an environment as an unknown parameter, and discussing the bias and variance of plug-in and rarefied estimates. I describe the state of the statistical literature for addressing these problems, focusing on the analysis of microbial diversity. I argue that latent variable models can address issues with variance, but bias corrections need to be utilized as well. I encourage ecologists to use estimates of diversity that account for unobserved species, and to use measurement error models to compare diversity across ecosystems.},

  abstract = {ABsTRACT This report compiles and reviews environmental impact assessment (EIA) and environmental monitoring procedures and practices in salmon cage aquaculture in Canada, Chile, Ireland, New Zealand, Norway, the United Kingdom and the United States of America. The regulatory process for pre-development EIA in each of the 7 countries is described. For existing farms, environmental monitoring regulations and practices are described and differences of approach noted. Weaknesses are highlighted and some suggestions for improvement are given. All the countries studied have a regulatory system in place for a systematic study of the environmental costs and benefits of a proposed new salmon farm (EIA). The EIA system highlights potentially negative environmental impacts but socio-economic costs and benefits are generally not part of the EIA process. However, in some countries, e.g. Scotland, a brief socio-economic analysis is often included. A more rigorous and explicit approach to assessing socio-economic costs and benefits would be very helpful in allowing decision-makers to balance these against any environmental costs. All countries have regulations regarding the monitoring of existing salmon farms to ensure compliance with a variety of environmental standards. In most countries there is a perception that regulation does offer protection to the environment. However, in most cases farmers regard the regulatory process as relatively slow and bureaucratic. This is particularly the case in the United States of America where responders to a questionnaire indicated that development was stifled by the complex regulatory regime. In Chile, while regulations and standards exist, there is a perception that regulatory authorities have insufficient resources to adequately monitor performance and police compliance. In all countries, but particularly in North America, greater dialogue between all stakeholders in a non-litigious arena would be highly beneficial, as there appears to be considerable mistrust between the industry, the regulators and NGOs. Interchange of scientists and regulators between salmon growing countries and the willingness to learn from regulatory developments in other countries, must be strongly supported. All countries need to put greater effort into determining impacts at the waterbody rather than site scale. This requires modelling approaches backed up by long time-series measurements for validation and calibration.},

  abstract = {The integration of environmental DNA (eDNA) within management strategies for lotic organisms requires translating eDNA detection and quantification data into inferences of the locations and abundances of target species. Understanding how eDNA is distributed in space and time within the complex environments of rivers and streams is a major factor in achieving this translation. Here we study bidimensional eDNA signals in streams to predict the position and abundance of Atlantic salmon (               Salmo salar               ) juveniles. We use data from sentinel cages with a range of abundances (3–63 juveniles) that were deployed in three coastal streams in New Brunswick, Canada. We evaluate the spatial patterns of eDNA dispersal and determine the effect of discharge on the dilution rate of eDNA. Our results show that eDNA exhibits predictable plume dynamics downstream from sources, with eDNA being initially concentrated and transported in the midstream, but eventually accumulating in stream margins with time and distance. From these findings we developed a fish detection and distribution prediction model based on the eDNA ratio in midstream versus bankside sites for a variety of fish distribution scenarios. Finally, we advise that sampling midstream at every 400 m is sufficient to detect a single fish at low velocity, but sampling efforts need to be increased at higher water velocity (every 100 m in the systems surveyed in this study). Studying salmon eDNA spatio-temporal patterns in lotic environments is essential to developing strong quantitative population assessment models that successfully leverage eDNA as a tool to protect salmon populations.},

  abstract = {Foreword The WorldFish mission is to strengthen livelihoods and enhance food and nutrition security by improving fisheries and aquaculture. We pursue this through research partnerships focused on helping those who stand to benefit the most—poor producers and consumers, women and children. The UN High Level Panel of Experts on Food Security and Nutrition (HLPE) recently concluded that fish is " crucial to any debate and action to reduce poverty and improve food security and nutrition. " In a world where climate change, water and land scarcity, ecosystem decline, and shifting consumption patterns pose critical risks to sustainable agricultural production, recognition of the power of fisheries and aquaculture is growing fast. WorldFish uses its expertise in fisheries and aquaculture to develop technological innovations, strengthen institutions and policies, and deliver transformational impacts. We focus on fish for the following reasons: • Fish is the animal-source food with the fastest-growing production in the world. In low-income food deficit countries it is also often the cheapest and most accessible animal-source food for poor consumers. • Sustainable aquaculture practices offer water, energy and feed conversion efficiencies superior to any other domesticated animal food production system—and fish is the only animal-source food that can be produced in saltwater, offering unique advantages for climate resilient production. • Fisheries and aquaculture contribute to the livelihoods of 800 million people; in the fisheries sector, 90 percent of those are in small-scale fisheries and 97 percent live in developing countries. • Sustainable intensification of production—including in integrated fish and farming systems—along with nutrition-sensitive processing and trade, offer distinct opportunities to build the income and assets of women and youth. • Fish consumption has a critical role to play in boosting dietary diversity and reducing the number of people who suffer from micronutrient deficiencies, with lifelong benefits for health and productivity. This strategy details the ambitious impact targets we have embraced, which are aligned with the UN Sustainable Development Goals, and charts our course to achieve them. We focus our research on the three interlinked challenges of sustainable aquaculture, resilient small-scale fisheries, and enhancing the contributions of fish to nutrition of the poor in the places where we can make the most difference. These challenges will only be met by partnering with the communities, research innovators, entrepreneurs and investors who give fisheries and aquaculture their dynamism and promise.},

Traits and community compositions showed clear spatial and temporal variations. Among a variety of biological traits, feeding type and body size emerged as strongest predictable variables. Functional divergence (FDiv) had an advantage over two other functional diversity indices, as well as over classical diversity measures (i.e. richness, evenness, Shannon-Wiener) to infer environmental status. Significant correlations between biological traits, FDiv and environmental variables (i.e. nutrients, temperature, salinity) suggested that functional diversity of benthic ciliates might be used as a bio-indicator in environmental status assessments. Further mandatory researches need to implement functional diversity of ciliates in routine monitoring programs were discussed.},

The eDNA metabarcoding based on a 6-h collection of water samples detected 128 fish species, of which 62.5\% (40 species) were also observed by underwater visual censuses conducted over a 14-year period. This method also detected other local fishes (≥23 species) that were not observed by the visual censuses. These eDNA metabarcoding features will enhance marine ecosystem-related research, and the method will potentially become a standard tool for surveying fish communities.},

The environmental DNA (eDNA)-based approach has unprecedented advantages (e.g., high throughput, high efficiency and low cost) for biodiversity surveys in both freshwater and marine ecosystems compared with traditional sampling and image recognition. The use of eDNA has been mostly limited to biodiversity estimation, how to apply the eDNA approach in assessing the ecological health status is largely unexplored. Here, using zooplankton as an example, we examined the application of eDNA monitoring for ecological status assessment in an aquatic ecosystem. The results showed that eDNA monitoring reflected the spatial and temporal variations in zooplankton structure. Both species composition and bio-interactions varied significantly between sampling seasons (dry, normal and wet). A total of 60 different zooplankton indices were calculated based on eDNA monitoring and most of these indices were highly correlated with the level of water pollution, which was indicated by the water quality index in one or all three seasons. Both qualitative and quantitative eDNA-based biological indices were correlated with water quality. The season-dependent eDNA zooplankton integrity index (IZI) reflected the ecological status, and this method improves the timeliness of bioassessment.},

Preliminary laboratory research has also shown a positive correlation between the concentration of species‐specific eDNA particles and the density/biomass of a species in a given environment. However, the extent to which these results can be extended to natural environments has yet to be formally quantified. We collated data from experiments that examined the correlation between eDNA and two metrics of abundance (biomass and density) and, using mixed‐effects meta‐analysis, quantified the strength of that correlation across laboratory and natural environments. We found that eDNA particle concentration was more strongly correlated with abundance in laboratory environments compared to natural environments, accounting for approximately 82\% and 57\% of the observed variation in abundance, respectively. We found some evidence of potential publication bias that may have impacted the estimation of the correlation in natural environments; after smaller studies were removed from the dataset, eDNA particle concentration accounted for approximately 50\% of the observed variation in abundance in natural environments. No effect of abundance metric was found on the strength of correlation between eDNA particle concentration and abundance. Despite a weaker general correlation in natural environments, eDNA concentration often still explained substantial variation in abundance. eDNA research is still an emergent field of study; with only moderate improvements in technology or technique, it could represent a powerful new tool for quantifying abundance.},

  abstract = {Organism abundance is a critical parameter in ecology, but its estimation is often challenging. Approaches utilizing eDNA to indirectly estimate abundance have recently generated substantial interest. However, preliminary correlations observed between eDNA concentration and abundance in nature are typically moderate in strength with significant unexplained variation. Here, we apply a novel approach to integrate allometric scaling coefficients into models of eDNA concentration and organism abundance. We hypothesize that eDNA particle production scales nonlinearly with mass, with scaling coefficients {$<$} 1. Wild populations often exhibit substantial variation in individual body size distributions; we therefore predict that the distribution of mass across individuals within a population will influence population-level eDNA production rates. To test our hypothesis, we collected standardized body size distribution and mark–recapture abundance data using whole-lake experiments involving nine populations of brook trout. We correlated eDNA concentration with three metrics of abundance: density (individuals/ha), biomass (kg/ha) and allometrically scaled mass (ASM) (∑(individual mass0.73)/ha). Density and biomass were both significantly positively correlated with eDNA concentration (adj. r2 = 0.59 and 0.63, respectively), but ASM exhibited improved model fit (adj. r2 = 0.78). We also demonstrate how estimates of ASM derived from eDNA samples in "unknown" systems can be converted to biomass or density estimates with additional size-structure data. Future experiments should empirically validate allometric scaling coefficients for eDNA production, particularly where substantial intraspecific size distribution variation exists. Incorporating allometric scaling may improve predictive models to the extent that eDNA concentration may become a reliable indicator of abundance in nature.},

For a sample of 132 nations, we use ordinary-least-squares (OLS) regression to assess the effects of modernization and ecological context on per capita meat and fish consumption. We find that ecological conditions in a nation, such as resource availability and climate, influence meat and fish consumption. Additionally, indicators of modernization, particularly economic development, influence the consumption of both meat and fish. However, the effect of economic development on consumption patterns is distinctly different among geographic regions. We conclude that in order to understand national dietary patterns, researchers need to take into account not only ecological context and economic development, but also regional/cultural factors. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Research institutions worldwide increasingly employ HTS methods for biodiversity assessments. However, variance in laboratory procedures, analytical workflows and bioinformatic pipelines impede the transferability and comparability of results across research groups. An international experiment was conducted to assess the consistency of metabarcoding results derived from identical samples and primer sets using varying laboratory proce2dures. Homogenized biofouling samples collected from four coastal locations (Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the USA) were distributed to 12 independent laboratories. Participants were asked to follow one of two HTS library preparation workflows. While DNA extraction, primers and bioinformatic analyses were purposefully standardized to allow comparison, many other technical variables were allowed to vary among laboratories (amplification protocols, type of instrument used, etc.). Despite substantial variation observed in raw results, the primary signal in the data was consistent, with the samples grouping strongly by geographical origin for all data sets. Simple post hoc data clean-up by removing low-quality samples gave the best improvement in sample classification for nuclear 18S rRNA gene data, with an overall 92.81\% correct group attribution. For mitochondrial COI gene data, the best classification result (95.58\%) was achieved after correction for contamination errors. The identified critical methodological factors that introduced the greatest variability (preservation buffer, sample defrosting, template concentration, DNA polymerase, PCR enhancer) should be of great assistance in standardizing future biodiversity studies using metabarcoding.},

In the present study three of these indices, the traditional Shannon Wiener Index (H′) and the more recently published AMBI (AZTI′ Marine Biotic Index) and BQI (Benthic Quality Index), were tested along a salinity gradient in the southern Baltic Sea. The comparison of the three indices demonstrates that in the southern Baltic Sea the ecological quality (EcoQ) classification based on macrozoobenthic communities as indicator greatly depends on the biotic index chosen. We found a significant positive relation between species number, H′, BQI and salinity resulting in EcoQ status of "Bad", "Poor" or "Moderate" in areas with a salinity value below 10 psu. The AMBI was less dependent on salinity but appear to partly overestimate the EcoQ status. Presently none of these biotic indices appear to be adjusted for application in a gradient system as given in the southern Baltic Sea. A potential approach describing how to overcome this limitation is discussed. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

However, spatial variations in catchability have been rarely evaluated, especially in the multispecies context. We advocate that the need for multispecies models stands for both challenges and opportunities to handle spatial catchability. This study evaluated the influence of spatially varying catchability on the performance of a novel joint species distribution model, namely Hierarchical Modelling of Species Communities (HMSC). We implemented the model under nine simulation scenarios to account for diverse spatial patterns of catchability and conducted empirical tests using survey data from Yellow Sea, China. Our results showed that ignoring variability in catchability could lead to substantial errors in the inferences of species response to environment. Meanwhile, the models’ predictive power was less impacted, yielding proper predictions of relative abundance. Incorporating a spatially autocorrelated structure substantially improved the predictability of HMSC in both simulation and empirical tests. Nevertheless, combined sources of spatial catchabilities could largely diminish the advantage of HMSC in inference and prediction. We highlight situations where catchability needs to be explicitly accounted for in modelling fish distributions, and suggest directions for future applications and development of JSDMs.},

  abstract = {The fundamental role of bacteria in global biogeochemical cycles warrants a thorough understanding of the factors controlling bacterial community structure. In this study, the integrated effect of seasonal differences and spatial distribution on bacterial community structure and diversity were investigated at the regional scale. We conducted a comprehensive bacterial survey, with 451 samples of the Scotian Shelf sector of the Northwest Atlantic Ocean during spring and fall of 2014 and 2016, to analyze the effects of physicochemical gradients on bacterial community structure. Throughout the region, Pelagibacteraceae and Rhodobacteraceae were the most common in the free-living fraction, while Flavobacteriia and Deltaproteobacteria were more abundant in the particle-associated fraction. Overall, there was strong covariation of the microbial community diversity from the two size fractions. This relationship existed despite the statistically significant difference in community structure between the free-living and particle-associated size fractions. In both size fractions, distribution patterns of bacterial taxa, and species within taxa, displayed temporal and spatial preferences. Distinct bacterial assemblages specific to season and depth in the water column were identified. These distinct assemblages, consistent for both 2014 and 2016, suggested replicable patterns in microbial communities for spring and fall in this region. Over all sites, temperature and oxygen values were highly correlated with community similarity, and salinity and oxygen values were the most strongly positively- and negatively correlated with alpha diversity, respectively. However, the strengths of these correlations depended on the depth and season sampled. The bathymetry of the Scotian Shelf, the abrupt shelf break to the Scotian Slope and the major ocean currents dominating in the region led to the formation of distinct on-shelf and off-shelf bacterial communities both in spring and fall. The highest species richness was observed at the shelf break, where water masses from the two major currents meet. Our study establishes the baseline for assessing future changes in the bacterial community of the Scotian Shelf waters, a rapidly changing sector of the Atlantic Ocean.},

  abstract = {The difficulty of censusing fish diversity hampers effective management and conservation in estuarine and coastal ecosystems, especially wetland ecosystems. Improved noninvasive fish diversity monitoring programs are becoming increasingly crucial for coastal ecosystems. In this study, we investigated fish diversity and its seasonal variation in the Nansha wetland ecosystem using environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding and bottom trawling, and the two approaches were compared. With the combination of the two methods, the identified fish taxa included 78 species within 60 genera and 33 families, and five nontarget taxa were only identified by eDNA metabarcoding. Compared to the two surveys, eDNA metabarcoding identified a significantly greater number of fish species per site and per season than bottom trawling (p\,{$<$}\,0.05), with eDNA metabarcoding identifying 32.05\% more fish species than bottom trawling. The overwhelming majority of the fish orders captured in the Nansha coastal wetland by bottom trawling were recovered from eDNA analysis, although certain taxa were not sampled due to limitations. Furthermore, the Whittaker index and relative abundance analysis of the two methods showed distinct differences between the sampling seasons, suggesting seasonal variations and reflecting the current or recent existence of fish species in the coastal ecosystem. Thus, our work provides more detailed seasonal data on biodiversity in the Nansha wetland of the Pearl River Estuary, which is essential for the long-term management and conservation of coastal biodiversity. Our study also adds to the evidence that the eDNA metabarcoding approach can be used in coastal environments to monitor a broad range of taxa and reflect seasonal fluctuations in fish diversity. As an emerging and transformative method, eDNA metabarcoding shows great potential for fish diversity monitoring in coastal wetland ecosystems.},

Predicting habitat to optimize sampling of Pacific sardine (Sardinops sagax). – ICES Journal of Marine Science, 68: 867–879. More than 40 years after the collapse of the fishery for Pacific sardine, a renewed fishery has emerged off the west coasts of the United States and Canada. The daily egg production method (DEPM) and acoustic-trawl surveys are performed annually and, to minimize the uncertainties in the estimates, sampling effort needs to be allocated optimally. Here, based on a 12-year dataset including the presence/absence of sardine eggs and concomitant remotely sensed oceanographic variables, a probabilistic generalized additive model is developed to predict spatio-temporal distributions of habitat for the northern stock of Pacific sardine in the California Current. Significant relationships are identified between eggs and sea surface temperature, chlorophyll a concentration, and the gradient of sea surface altitude. The model accurately predicts the habitat and seasonal migration pattern of sardine, irrespective of spawning condition. The predictions of potential habitat are validated extensively by fishery landings and net-sample data from the northeast Pacific. The predicted habitat can be used to optimize the time and location of the DEPM, acoustic-trawl, and aerial surveys of sardine. The method developed and illustrated may be applicable too to studies of other stocks of sardine and other epipelagic fish in other eastern boundary, upwelling regions.},

  abstract = {Abstract             We confirm that sardine recruitment in the California Current, during the last three decades, mimics aspects of the environment in the North Pacific indicated by the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) index. The periods of stock increase and decrease followed consecutive years with positive and negative PDO values, respectively. During the “warm” periods, the average number of recruits per biomass was more than threefold higher than that during the “cold” periods. In addition to the environmental conditions experienced by the sardine larvae, we show that the variability in sardine recruitment is partially explained by the environmental conditions many months before the spawning season and the adult condition factor. We hypothesize that sardine have a metabolic deficit during spawning, so prior good feeding opportunities are necessary to increase both total fecundity and offspring robustness, to enhance both reproduction and survival, respectively. Our findings augment a century-old theory that the reproductive success of small pelagic fish is governed by the survival of the early life stages. The condition of each parent also matters. To predict sardine recruitment, we propose a “dual-phase” model based on seasonal PDO-based indices and a condition factor. The model identifies summer feeding seasons conducive to a good adult condition factor followed by spring-spawning seasons supportive of good larval retention and growth.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Three years after the 2015 collapse of the northern stock of Pacific Sardine that is predominantly located off the west coast of the United States, acoustic‐trawl (A‐T) surveys documented an increase in the presence and persistence of the southern stock off coastal Southern California. Then in 2020, the biomass of Sardine that was landed in Mexico and attributed to the northern stock exceeded the estimated biomass for the entire northern stock. To investigate if the landings were incorrectly classified, we revisit a model of northern‐stock potential habitat and the associated range of sea‐surface temperature (               SST               ) used to apportion the A‐T survey data and monthly fishery landings to the two stocks, respectively. We update the probabilistic model of potential habitat with data on sardine‐egg presence and absence and concomitant satellite‐sensed SST and chlorophyll‐               a               concentration through 2019 and apply the new model to more accurately attribute the A‐T observations and fishery landings data to the northern or southern stock. The addition of recent data, with increased coverage in               SST               s between 15°C and 17°C, improves the model accuracy and spatial precision of the stock attribution. The attribution accuracy is critically dependent on the temporal and spatial coincidence of the environmental and survey or landings data and should be corroborated with other characteristics indicative of biological isolation such as spatial separation, distinct spawning areas and seasons, and uncorrelated demographics.},
